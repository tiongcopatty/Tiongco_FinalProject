1,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 more and more people start to use computers, goes more and more into the dark aged. While computer @MONTH1 be helpful in some cases, they are also making people excercize less, most @CAPS1 many people are nature, and more people are becoming awkward. So are computer advancement recently worth society becoming less interactive? The answer is no. With more thing to do on the computer people arent getting enough exercize to keep up a healthy regimens. Kids would rather waste time on the computer than go out play. @NUM1 years ago, when most that many people had computers, you could see people outside playing and having fun with each other, But now, when you look outside, no one is on the local playground having fun and exercising, they are on the internet. ""@PERCENT1 of kids, who spend most of their time on the computer, are over-weight and unhealthy, compared to the @PERCENT2 of kids who are outside playing and a healthy weight."" says @PERSON1, @CAPS2. So really the problem to over-weight, its lack of exercize from the computers. Not only are people getting less exercize, they are also not experiencing the healty of nature. With less people going going outside, of exercize, waste nature healty because no-one gets to use it, and harm social skills and family relationships. So please, get off the computer and enjoy life.",7
2,"Dear @LOCATION1 Time @CAPS1 me tell you what I think of computers there is nothing wrong with people being on computers. I say this because us as kids really do need computers for projects and school work. Also because what if your parents want to move or get a better job but have no car they can use they're computer. Computers actually help the human mind. If you get bored then get on the computer sit back and relax while I explain. In addition I'm not saying that you can use your computer for everything say for an example your teacher gives you an assignment and you can't find it in your book your going to use the computer. If you need pictures for a project but your not an very good artist then you can use your computer. so at the end computer's aren't so bad after all. For an example my mom doesn't have a car or know how to drive. So when she needs to look for a job and no one is there to take her she get's on the internet and find one. Also when it was time for her to move she got on the computer and found a @LOCATION1 house. So like I said computer's are not as bad as people think. When kid's get bored and it's snowing outside and nothing on t.v. Then they can go on the computer, it's not like they don't have educational sites. They have first in math and math for fun. So don't think it's just websites to chat with your friends. In conclusion don't make it seem as through the computer isn't useful because it is. The computer even teach's me things every now and then. So I would say computers @CAPS2! So don't be such a grumpy person because they probably help you sometimes.",8
3,"Dear Local newspaper, Have you been spending a good portion of your time on computers? Do you think it is effecting you in anyway? Well in this writing piece I am going to tell you how I believe the computers effect you aand everyone else. My first piece of information for the way computers effect people is if they are on the omputer playing games, emailing or listening to music, that is more time you miss spending with thier family or going outside. If they miss time to spend with thier family then you could slowly start drifting apart from them, especially if they don't live near you. One day when that person passed away and you think back you are going to wish you weren't on the compuer three times they were over, you are going to wish you were down there spending time with them. If you miss going outside that is a whole new thing you are missing the sunshine, the snow or whatever kind of temparature there is outside and either way being outside in the fresh air is healthy and so much better than being inside on a computer. The second way computer could effect someones lifen is if you are in a chat room talking to someone and you don't know who it is you have no way to know for sure who you are talking to. It could be a creepy adult or a murder and you'd be thinking that it is a cod kid that wants to be your friends and you could end up letting some information slip. He could ask you to meet him somewhere and they could endup taking you forever and during that time you were talking to him you could of been doing something else than talk to some stranger on the computer. My last thing I believe that bthe computer has an effect on people is that they won't be us active. they'd be lounging around all day on the computer instead of playing a sport or running around outside. Who cares if you colud get hand eye coordination you can play @NUM1 @CAPS1-box with your family and still it's because you get hand eye coordination and youre spending time with family. Even better than that you could be palying outside with your family it will keep you extremely more active than anything and you will be able to spend time with your family. Now that I told you aall of those reasons the computers effect you should know now that spending time off the computer is much more healthier than sitting on the computer all day.",9
4,"Dear Readers, @CAPS1 you imagine how life would be if we all stop sitting on our behinds on the computer all day but enjoying mother nature? The issue is that experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computer and less time excercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. I think we should give the computers a break so that we @CAPS1 get enough excercise, so we @CAPS1 enjoy nature, and so that we @CAPS1 keep our knowledge. I think that we should give the computer a break so that we @CAPS1 start excercising. Who wouldn't want to excersize to stay in shape. I remember when me and my mom used to exercise once a day so that we @CAPS1 stay in good shape. Surely if you go on the computer everyday instead of exercising you will start to gain weight. Who would want to gain weight? Why should a person not exercise and stay healthy? Another reason why we should give computers a break is so that people @CAPS1 enjoy nature. For example, they @CAPS1 go to the park or even ride their bikes. In @ORGANIZATION1 school @PERCENT1 say that they love to ride their bike instead of going on the computer. Why not go outside and smell the fresh air, or even go swimming at the beach? Another reason we should give the computer a break is so that we @CAPS1 keep their knowledge. For example if you stay on the computer and play games you will lose your focus on work. Why should your parents be worried because their kids grades are slowly decreasing and decreasing every second. Why should smart kids get low grades over playing games on their computers? So now I say ""I wont waste my knowledge ever again"". It's now or never! Should kids give the computer a break or not. I think they should because they wont get enough exercise, so that the kids @CAPS1 enjoy mother nature. Also so that they @CAPS1 keep their knowledge. This is why kids should to focusing on computers. So why not go waisting your time and knowledge on computers now!",9
5,"Dear newspaper, I strongly believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers help with education believe it or not. They let people keep in touch with each other no matter where they are. Also computers help people with so many useful things. Education is a very important thing in life. And computers are a big part of education. In my school we do many things on the computer like typing papers, research projects, and sometimes even rests. Computers dont only help with education in school but at our own homes too. When your surfing the web you might come across articles of people and places and that helps your education. The computer is also a good place to learn about history, you can find out about the worlds history or maybe even your own family history. Computers can teach people a lot. Computers can also be helpful for peoples health if you use them the right way. Instead of looking up silly stuff look up what foods you can eat that are good for you and what you can do to stay healthy. You can look up recipes that are healthy and delicous. On the computer you can get tons of other peoples opinions on ways to stay healthy which is better than just getting our opinion from somebody you know. Computers can also help you excercise. You can find out different types of excercises and stretches. You can even watch excercising videos and follow along with them. Its possible that you find a video or type of excercise that works good for you. Instead of searching things on the internet that are not useful look up something important like your health. Computers are useful in thousands of different ways. One way is keeping in touch with people. I keep in touch with my friends by using facebook, myspace, and aim. A lot of other people use these sites to. These sites also help me keep in touch with my family. I talk to cousins that live a city down from mine and even my family members that live across the country and in another continent. Computers are also not just for the important things in life there to have fun too. There are millions of websites with games, jokes, and funny videos. There are so many uses for a computer. In conclusion computers have a very positive effect on people. They help children and adults with there education and learning. The internet can also help people live healthy so they can have a happy life. There are so many different uses of a computer, you can do almost anything on it. Computers can defenitely have a positive effect on people.",9
6,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 the caveman found fire, ever, thought what would happen if he did not use it? Well that is where we are today. The computer is our fire. Some people might not be able to compare a computer to fire, but the advancement in technology is just about the same. There are now tons of people who use computer. I definetly agree that we should continue the use of computers. Computers help people learn, we can communicate better, and it will allow us to advance farther. The computer can help us learn. It can teach us about faraway places that we probably would never have known that they existed. We can learn about the weather better. If we did not did not have computers we would have never left earth. Or be able to make @CAPS2. The computer has already helped us a math teacher, @PERSON1 said"" Computers have boosted the kids knowledge @CAPS5 much. I never learned some of the stuff @CAPS1 i was growing up. This next generation will be the we have had yet."" @CAPS3 more than we could have alone, @CAPS5 why get rid of it? The computer can also help us communicate better and faster. which the avoke in the @LOCATION2 happened, it might have taken a weck or even a month for the @LOCATION1 to hear about it, and longer to try and go down to help. By then the people would have to try and fix it. it up themselves for two months or more. I remember yesterday. I had a board of education meeting to go to. It was really importan checking my @CAPS4-mails on the computer and I found out that i needed to go. It was better that i found out and not the next day @CAPS1 my boss was going to yell at me because i did not go. That is how useful the computer is to communicate. The computer is also goind to help us @CAPS3 farther. It is like the fire. It helped People @CAPS3 @CAPS5 much, @CAPS5 once the computer is at its peak, it will push us just as for the fire did. Survey shows that @PERCENT1 of the children population is already smarter than the adult population. @CAPS5 @CAPS1 the children become adults there is nothing this world cannot do. we would be able to colonize the galaxy! @CAPS5, as you can see, computers are more beneficial than bad. they help teach people new stuff, communicate faster and better, and will help us @CAPS3 farther. Think about it, millions of years from now, people will say, ""@CAPS6 if man never made computers, that would be worse than the fall of empire."" @CAPS7 you for taking the time to read this letter.",9
7,"Dear newspaper editor, @CAPS1 now is a letter to explain to us all, that computers are not a major destroyer of society. They don't just make people exercise less, they don't just make people interact less with family. They help so much, and not many people can see that. Computers are a wonderful thing to society. They help people make friends, they help with giving information, and they make our lives easier. For a start, computers are good because they introduce us to new people. For example, if you are shy or socially awkward, you know it's very hard to make new friends. However, with a computer you won't feel as shy, which helps make friends easily! Another example is that if no one wants to be your friend for your appearance, then the computer can help. You can make friends without being seen by them which is a great thing if you are emoarressed or being stopped by your appearance. Computers help make friends in many more ways as well. Therefore, computers are a great thing for a society. They also provide us information. Another reason why computers are a nice thing for our society, is that they give us info. If you need help on some work or a project, for example, you can find almost anything from the computer. maybe you even want to study for a test; you can study on the computers. Also, you can learn about any place in the world. If you need information of a hotel, you just want to learn or if you want to know about something that happened there, it's all on the computer. Even if you just wont the news of one place, you can find it with the computer. Thus, makes the computer a fantastic item that helps the society. Besides info, they make our lives easier. As my final reason, computers benefit society by making our lives easier to handle. Such a way they do this is that make files easier to make and organize. When writing something it might have mistakes and be harder to read, but computers show your mistakes and have easy to read fonts. My next example in that when you have something in real life it is so easy to lose or misplace. On the other hand, computers store whatever you upload, so they cant be lost. Something as important as pictures can be saved by adding them to your computers. As you can see, computers help the lives of all. Now you can agree with me when I say. Computers have a huge effect on society. They show us new people. They consist of much helpful info. They make.",9
8,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1, there has been some talk about how computers are changing our world for the better. Computers are apparently the only way their we will survive in the future. This is nonsense! Computers are taking away our valuable sleep hours, our rights to a good education, and our health! Computers are in fact the way of the unhealthy future. I ask you to go ahead a think about the time you spend on the computer. The average teen in the year @DATE1 spent @NUM1 hours a day on the computer. Now compare that to the amount of time you spent as keep. Chances are high that you only get @NUM1 or @NUM3 hours asleep making the amount of time you spent going on the web and the amount of beauty set you got about the same. That right there should tell you, that something is arong with the computer lifestyle. We all fall victim to drowsiness.. every once in a while is alright. However, for every hour you spend on the computer your are @PERCENT1 sleeper then you were! @CAPS5 is the price of losing energy worth @CAPS4? Did you know that millions of people wake up as early as they can just to be playing on the computer. Some wake up as early as @NUM4 in the morning! Forgive me if I'mmistaken but @NUM4 o'clock in the morning just to talk on facebook is breaching insanity. Sleep is important @CAPS5 playing on the computer isn't worth our @NUM6's. Not only is losing precious sleep bed but now the devil's invention is deleting our education from our now computer operated minds! Ask any student how much time they spend studying the answer will be I don't need to study. ""@CAPS2 that sound right. Kids do need to study they just want to chat with friends online. The average students grade went down @PERCENT2 list year because of all the time spent on the computer. Speaking of the ever trendy online chat..how many time have you heard lol, omg, or @CAPS3? Well one things for sure @CAPS4 in papers, worksheets, and just about anything that a computer kids hands in! Another issue is that kids who don't care about school are effecting the thought of those who do. One kid said ""@CAPS4's only cool to talk online school is for."" This is the wrong message to send kids! School is cool. Finally computers are throwing away our health. More and more people are getting diseases because they spend too much time in front of the screens @PERCENT2 more people got diabetes last year do to lack of exercise. Playing sports has been proven as away to make a child more well rounded. Computers do net, @CAPS5 don't we want to un-plug ourselves and live dive into sports? Sports will also make your mind more fit. They will teach you to work as a team and not give in to peer pressure. @CAPS5 as you can see computers are lending this world down a dark road. @CAPS4's time we say enough and become unplugged! Our life shouldn't be compermised for time spent on the computer. These inventions are giving us less beauty sleep, throwing our education in the recycling bin, and giving us a life with our health! Stop this injustice and unplug that computer!",11
9,"Dear Local Newspaper, I would like to complain about the everyday use of computers. I believe that now in days the use of computers are being abused. Many people use the computer and doesn’t spend time with the family. The everyday use of computers is also causing certain people to gain access weight. Another reason is that by staring at the screen can create eye damage! As you knew my first complaint is how by being on the computer s much it takes away time spent with family and friends. Most of the day you are on the computer gives no room for family time. So that for one is not a great thing. My second reason people shouldn't be on the computer so much is because it's causing people to gain access weight. By just sitting on the computer all day you get no exercise whatsoever, so you gain weight not wanted. The only thing your body that gets exercise while on the computer is your fingers. Also the human body needs exercise! My final reason that the computer shouldn't be in so much use is because it can cause eye damage. When your eyes look at the screen for a long period of time, they tend to strain. So this can cause your next trip to the eye doctor. Well I have explained all my reasons to you and I hope you understand. Computers are fun but you got to give them a rest sometimes unless you want to lose time with the family, gain weight, or maybe your next trip to the eye doctor then you might want to turn it off and go jogging, or camping with the family! Thank you for taking time off your schedule to read my complaints!",8
10,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 having kids wasting there whole lives by being on the computer to much. I sure wouldn’t want my son to be like that. Being on the computer too much can make you unhealthy from not exercising, not be able to enjoy nature, and keep you away from you friends and family. Not much good can came out of being on the computer @NUM1. Please newspaper take my word. @CAPS4 will make you well known @CAPS3 you agree with me on this. First of all, being on the computer all day, everyday can make you unhealthy by not exercising. @PERCENT2 of people that do not exercise live less longer to the people that do exercise. Times @CAPS2 said. “@CAPS3 you spend your life on the computer and don’t take a jog once in a while. Then @CAPS4 can hurt you body in a days, and way.” I believe that quote the @PERCENT1 @CAPS5. @PERSON2 stated to me, “@CAPS3 you can’t get off the computer, @CAPS4 can hurt your body badly and can make you less athletic because you are so used & not exercising, “@CAPS3 doctor said that you should believe @CAPS4 trust me this will be a great decision. You will see improvements everyday. Second of all. You won’t be to enjoy nature @CAPS3 you are on the computer for so long. @PERCENT3 of students that don’t get some fresh air once in a while can make them less with the worth. @CAPS5 @PERSON1 said, “ @CAPS3 you don’t pay attention to nature, then you won’t know anything about the earth and what have gone on “ that will not be helpful in your social studies class. Peoples @CAPS2 use said. “@CAPS7 on the computer and not enjoying the outdoors can actually make you less smarter on what you do. “I have even heard that same qoute from doctors, too my friend. Dive was a straight A student and very popular. He is a very tall and handsome kid. Then all of the sudden, one day he met a computer and invite sports and never went outside and @CAPS4 change him a lot. I would never want that to happen to me or any of my friends again. The is do you want to happen to you? Lastly computers can less interaction with friends and family. @PERCENT4 of students that still on the computer become less close with friends and even family. That is not a good thing at all. @CAPS5 @PERSON3 said, ""computer only cause mental and less interactions with friends & family at school. “@CAPS4 is very interesting that people still use computers after all of those reasons. The @CAPS8 @CAPS9 newspaper said, “computers decreasing bond of family and friends. “I agree with that statement the whole one yards. @CAPS4 is just very sad how people waste their lives doing same thing that is not good for them. Please make the next choice or @CAPS4 will be to late. To sum @CAPS4 all us. @CAPS1 children outside and could better. That can happen @CAPS3 you make the decision I am changing right now. @CAPS3 you don’t @CAPS4 can keep them from exercising, enjoying outdoors and nature, and interacting with family and friends. No one wants that, so please read my carefully newspaper make the decision and make @CAPS4 right.",10
11,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 should think that computers are a good thing because this technology help people everyday in many different ways. Computers can allow you to have fun playing games, do research for work, @CAPS4 new people, and many businesses are built around computers. Lets think about how a computer can effect @CAPS3's life. A man or women goes to work and then goes to the computer. Well maybe this man is a scientist who is using the computer to save findings, help research new ones, and make calculations, @CAPS5 job depends on computers to discover new findings. The man might be a person who answers @NUM1 calls. @CAPS5 computer can help save lives by telling them where the person in need is calling from and how to get there. So these machines are powerful work resourses. Computers can also entertain people when they get bored. It is just like any other video game, you get to go online and play with friends or make new friends in the proses. If a person is bored and has nothing to do then they can hop on a computers go to a website or put in a @CAPS6 and play many fun games. It is a good way to learn and entertain in your free time. People will alway learn from computers. You can find interesting facts, how to build things or just about anything you can think of will be on the computer. Besides many schools use computers to help educate their students by using interactive game that aid many kids into learning more can just teach them in general. The people will always think for themselves and most will not give their computer just because someone says that it is bad for them. I have opened up to the people to try to convince them that computers are not us but they are doing quite the opposite and are helping us in everyday life. They help us Learn, have fun, and some people even depend on them to make a living. Thank You.",8
12,"Dear Local @CAPS1, Computers, and other technology are very popular today. Many people look at computers saying well they are innapropriete the way children and young adults are using them. Well, those are only the negatives of computers there are many positive things in having a computer. Starting off with Online @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 @CAPS4, learning about faraway places. Lastly, chatting online with family or friends. First off, @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and online learning sites are populating more and more to this day. If our society didn't have online toutering or @CAPS3 @CAPS4 students wouldn't be able to learn up to their fullest potential. If a high amount of society didn't believe in online activities now would we as students get the knowledge we have now. Also, this online @CAPS2 is an opportunity for students to learn by themselves & classes that their school @MONTH1 not offer. If someone were to ever to take that away we would not be where we are today in this world because we would not have those people who went above and beyond in their learning due to society. Next, online chat is really big throughout our nation. This is an opportunity to talk with family members that live faraway. Also this is an opportunity to hook up with your old friends who @MONTH1 have moved away. About @PERCENT1 of our world looks at online chatrooms as being a bad influence on children when really the problem is the parents letting their (son/daughter) child use online chatroom who are immature. Lastly, online is a world to explore throughout. Just like the world we live in. You can go online and research any topic you want to such as culture through out our world. Different countries have different cultures and you can learn about them online. Also, you can find different attractions to different countries, states, counties and towns as well as book tours and go on trips to these places. Such as china you can start off by researching that country then you can go visit that country and see what you missed. There are many reasons to look at computers in a bad manor. I can see how: because people are taking advantage of technology and not using their own so it is brainwashing people and making @PERCENT2 of the people that use computer think one day nobody will live without using computers. There are many good reasons too have a computer. One is to advance your knowledge as far as you can. So why don't our society do so. And look at computer to @CAPS4 with peoples lives.",9
13,"Why people should use computers? Computers are good for people because you have something else to do while your learning things you don't know. One of the reasons why computers are good for people is because, family, friends around the world, like if your in other country and you can't see your family or friends you will just go on the computer and video chat with them, if you wanna keep in touch with people that you know for a long time the computer could keep them intouch, if you miss someone and you dont have a phone the computer might be a great idea. Also it helps you on questions that you have, if you don't know a word you can go on @ORGANIZATION1 and you will find the defenition if the teachers gives you homework and its very hard and you can't find the answer on the book the computer have all the answers you need, if your friends say something about any subject and you have no idea what are they talking about you could go look it up and learn something new in life. In the computer you could see things before anyone does, like you could whatch videos over and over again to see what real happend. It give you the real apportunity to learn something new that you will remember all your life, but computers are not use all the time you could spend sometime outside and have fun also. Computers are good for you and help you in your homework or in things you don't know, and getting in touch with people you wanna see/talk, the computers are a lot of fun, but also spending time outside with other people could be very nice too.",8
14,"@CAPS1, its time for supper! @CAPS2 on, mom I have to update my facebook!"" @CAPS3, times you as a reader, @MONTH1 have found yourself in a similar situation. Couped up in your basement updating friends spaces and playing games on your computer. You probably havent seen the sun in a few weeks, either. @CAPS3 argue this is bad because computers are addictive and restrict exersising, enjoying nature and social events such as family and friends. But is @CAPS9 really allthat bad? For instance, you can chat with people accross the globe, send and receive messages at breakreck speed, and learn things about farway places like the @ORGANIZATION5. this is where I stand on this contreversal debate. @CAPS6, @CAPS4 possibly the biggest thing since electricity. There are billions. No, @CAPS5 things to do on the @CAPS6 more other are being made each @CAPS14. Wether @CAPS9 be a fan site for people like @CAPS7.J sandwiches or a viral site such as @CAPS8 or myspace. And while @CAPS9 is addiding, @CAPS9 has @CAPS3 upsides to @CAPS9. @CAPS6 games help with hand-eye coordinating and @CAPS20 your ever sluck on homework. The @CAPS6 will teach you. This is only a small reason why computers are a good thing. @CAPS21 what @CAPS20 your computer doesn't support @CAPS6? what @CAPS9 good for? Nothing right? WRONG! The computer has installed apps such as the brain bending @CAPS10 sweeper, or the reaction testing pinball. Also, you can always install games like the @ORGANIZATION6 (real-time-strategy) @CAPS11, @ORGANIZATION2. this is on @ORGANIZATION3 the games, along with @ORGANIZATION3, and @ORGANIZATION3 @ORGANIZATION3 @CAPS12 that tasts how well your headership skills are along with money management, and planning. Furthermore, by buying old arcade games you can get to see what gaming was like ""@CAPS13 in the @CAPS14"". You can play old games such as @CAPS15, @CAPS16 @CAPS17, @ORGANIZATION4, and @CAPS18-@CAPS19. @CAPS21 why is @CAPS9 @CAPS21 bad ? Hear this: (quote @ORGANIZATION1 @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION1) ""@CAPS20 one is to stay on is to stay on the computer for @NUM1 hours a @CAPS14 for @NUM2 weeks, gain about @NUM3 pounds each week following."" @CAPS21 yes. you should limit your computer time. but did you know that @NUM4 out @ORGANIZATION3 @NUM5 people who are on the computer for @NUM6 hours a @CAPS14 also gain increase in skills such as typing speed, knowledge coordination. This is @CAPS22. @CAPS21, @CAPS23, is @CAPS9 really that bad? To sum @CAPS9 @CAPS23 up. Computers are a good thing. Furthermore, you can exceed life skills such as planning, and money management. Also, you can have an aspect @ORGANIZATION3 what gaming was like @CAPS13 then white @CAPS9 is @CAPS24 to get to know your world and the people in @CAPS9, you should your computer time to @NUM5-4 hours a @CAPS14 which reminds me @ORGANIZATION3 the time that a person @ORGANIZATION1 the @CAPS25.K for @NUM3 hours streight. @CAPS24, but not a good @CAPS26. @CAPS21 go get a computer and @CAPS27!""",12
15,"Dear local newspaper: I am writing this letter to tell you I think computers have a positive effect on people that they benifit in the society. I as a single person think computers benifit the society because they give people the ability to learn about faraway places, can let people talk and chat onlines with other people and can help with education. Now on to making sure you agree with me. First compouts can give people the ability to learn interesting facts on neat stuff about very faraway places that you have never ever herd of befor. For example once I had to do a movie on a forgive country that I knew nothing about so what did I do? I want to the computers. Thier I found many fact and data about the place. Now if I can do that you can to and it will be very quick and very easy. Secondly you can talk to people or live chat with people even if their miles away. Their is many different sites and places to chat too. Like me I go and talk to my friends on @CAPS1, or myspace oncwe in a while. Also lets say you haven'ts seen a relative in a while you realy want to see them. But its allmost impossible to well not anymore.",7
16,"Effects of computers @CAPS1 local newspaper, Have you ever realized @CAPS7 computers effect you and the people around you? well, I think the effects come in a bad way. for example, you could get abducted from strangers online, your grades would slip, and you wouldnt be able to live you life like a kid or adult anymore. @CAPS7, you will see my first explanation. First, you could get abducted from strangers online. When you're in the chat rooms, where you shouldn't be in the first place, kids and adults tend to talk to strangers. then they start telling them where they live, when puts both you and your family in jeapordy. This way, you shouldn't stay on the computer for a long time, because then you would be tempted to talk in chat rooms. Here is my next reason. Next, your grades would slip. When you get home, all you think about is, ""@CAPS2's new on facebook."" @CAPS3, ""@CAPS2 can I buy @CAPS7, this isn't healthy. You should be doing your homework when you get home. @CAPS3, adults should be worrying about bills, not about the email they just got, @CAPS5 time flys when you're on the computer, theres no way anyone will have time to do anything. @CAPS3, when you're at school or work, all you can think about is going home playing that new game on you computer. How are you suppost to concentrate on anything once you have that on you mind. Here's my last reason, @CAPS6, you wouldn't be able to live you life like an adult or child anymore. When you're a kid, you usually like playing outside, or playing with your pets, friends, and family. Well, when you spend most of your time on the computer, how are you going to burn calories, and run around by getting you energy out. You might even be a bad influence on you brother and sister. Without any exercise isn't good for your body. for adults, they wouldn't have time to pay for bills or spend time with their family. The kids would have no father figure to talk to or a mom to disguse their problems, @CAPS7 you will see all of my reasoning. In conclusion, computers control you life. I think they are truly just a device to make you loose control of you life. You could get abducted, you grades could slip, and you wouldn't be able to live your life. As you can see they inform but control.",8
17,"Dear to whom it @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1 is an issue on where technology benefical to our society. @CAPS1 are many ways people could benefit from new and advanced technology, and @CAPS1 ways people cannot. In this letter, I will be describing to you, the type of ways people can benefit from technology. First of all, computers give students and adults a chance of having an education. For example, if a young girl has a child and can't afford to stay in school, online classes gives them the chance to care for their child and still receive an education. If an adult a degree online will help them achieve. People need, technology offer, to give it. Secondly, some people are that if someone is always online, they will and see. He for what it is. Have you thought the flip side of that will computers, people can still explore the world. You can work. Finally, computer help families stay in touch. Computers are a great way for people to stay communicated. For example, maybe your phone isnt working properly or maybe not even working at all and you want to contact a friend or relative, you can easily go online with chat or webcam, etc to keep them notified on anything important or just to say hello. Wouldn't you want to still to communicate with too? In conclusion, Technology is advancing more and more, all the time. It's only getting better. Online classes, exploration of the world, and communicating with fellow people are just some of the things technology can do. Wouldn't you want to experience some of the things it can do?",8
18,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Advances in technology can ruin the future of our children. A computer, a thing that most people have although it comes with very good things about it there is also a lot of negative things. A couple examples are people can become addicted to the computer. So they stay all up in their house, in their room, where their computer is. Another reason is the dangers of computers. With technology advancing the internet is very dangerous and you have to be careful what information you give out. And at last cyber bullies just like actually bullies but instead of physically hurting someone cyber bullies mentally and emotionally take someone down and hurt them. As you can see these are only a few reasons why technology is becoming dangerous thing and has a negative effect on people and their life. Physical exercise is a good thing, it is needed if you want to stay and be a healthy person. But you can't get out go for a run and get physical exercise if your on the computer doing whatever you do. So the computer is haveing a negative affect on people because they arent getting at side and enjoying the fresh air. Instead they are inside on the computer. Alot of people are gamers so they could be all caught up in a whole different. That's a bad thing. It's bad becasue some people get so addicted to a game they gte addicted and maybe even. So if you obssesed with something your go to do it all the time, so when your inside being obsseses with whatever your obssesed to stay healthy. There are many dangers on the computer. For example petifiles. Petifiles are always on the for young kids they. Petifies disguse themselves as most likely teenagers or people on their @NUM1's and they tride kids into meeting or with them so the kids think they're meeting up with a person they thaght the petifile is but really they are just doing in a trap and could end up in a very dangerous serious situation that could end up death or go missing and never seen again. And dangerous thing on the internet is atlkers. This world isnt a safe the world is a cold and deciving place they is filled with people who will hate you and people who are crazy. So you have to be carefull on what kind of information you put out on the internet because you never know you could be stalked and that's another very dangerous situation. The last reason I'm going to mention is cyber bullies some might say are almost worse than actual bullies because cyber bullies mentally attack you and hurt you instead of physically. They are very mean people who will do whatever it takes to take somebody down. An example of a bad ending to cyber buling was there was a kid. I knew his name was @PERSON1.Everybody thaght he was gay because he didnt football as a summer so this buly went on @CAPS1 and started argue called @PERSON1 he is a gav fog and everybody and wrote mean comments about him and @PERSON1 got bullied so much couldnt like it anywhere and locked and hung himself and his mom found the next morning dead hanging in his closet. So as you can see their are many reasons why advance in technology isnt a good thing because many things even now have a bad turnout.",9
19,"Dear newspaper @CAPS1, I am writing this letter to state my opinion on if I think computers are good or bad. Well computers are becoming well known in society we can buy laptops, desktops, phones that can go on internet.t.v.s gaming systems. I do think that this could have an affect on kids not going ouside as much and not getting exercise and seeing nature, I do belive though technology is a big part of life as we get older all our jobs deal with using computers such as a banker, ultrasonagrapher, teacher. To be prepared for jobs in our upcoming futres students should be well known to a computer and know how to use it. They shoud be able to know how to do presentations with there computers type well without looking and set documents into folders. Although I think the kids should be using computers and have a computer class in school. It doesn't mean that they will always be on a computer. School has a big part of getting students to go outside, exercise. They are able to get that during gym and wehn weathers nicer they are able to go outside and do activities. The kids can also join school sports team and sports teams outside of school. Besides getting exercise they can also comunicate with people across the world this benifits from learning different people cultures. I comepletly think that technology will benefit people for life and it will have a positive outcome on them, I hope you can too.",8
20,"Dear Local newspaper, I do agree that to many people spend there time on the computers. In my opinion first I think they do because less time enjoying nature. Secondly, not enough time exercising. Also, there not interacting with family and friends @CAPS1 writing to urge you that to many people spend time on the computers. I hope you will agree with what @CAPS1 saying as you read on. As you can see many people spend alot of time on the computer but less time enjoying nature. For instance, you can go around help the community, help the homeless you can also have a day to your self go get some fresh air and take a walk. If I was oyu this is what I would do. Secondly, they spend to much time on the computers because they are not interacting with they family and friends. For example, I like to spend time with my family and friends. We go out to eat, the mall, we even sometimes just play the games together to have fun. Just like they should want to en joy being with there family and friends, you will have an closer relationship by doin that instead of being on the computer all day. Lastly, they spend to much time on the computers because they have less time exercising. In contrast like now we have alot of over weight teens. They rather be on the computer instead of going to a gym and exercise. I always try to exercise at home or when I'm playing basketball I do alot of running. If you ask me I believe exercising is better for you the sittin on the computer all day. In conclusion, as you can see less time enjoying nature, interacting with family and friends, and less time exercising. Is better for you than being on the computer being lazy. I hope that you will understand the way I am feeling about this situation.",8
21,"Dear Local Newspaper, I heard about people's opinions on computers and I thought I should share my thoughts on what I think being a person who spends an hour on the computer a day, I completley understand what people say when they say computers can be a distractment @MONEY1 your life. But I do not agree with this. There ore some positive things about computers. Some people in the world can not find jobs. Some people in the world have amazing talents and they are not discovered it. This is where websites like youtube.com come into play. People who are musically talented sometimes set discovered in youtube, and then in a flash they are making @MONEY1 a year. If the world did not have computers, very talented singers would not be where they are today. You tube is not the only website that is changing. Facebook.com can help you re-connect with the people to lost touch with. I was reading a magazine one day and I read about a girl who lost touch with her biological brother and found him so facebook. Sometimes computers can bring people together, and that is definetly not a bad thing. Have you ever gotten sick @MONEY1 your life and wanted to go on a nice vacation? I bet @NUM1 out @MONEY1 @NUM2 readers in this paper would say that in some days, they would not mind a great escape. Computers can help you research far away places so you know where you would be going computers can give up the information you need so you will know anything and everything about where you are headed. Some people @MONTH1 beleve that computers are not necessary because instead @MONEY1 being online, you could be excersising or doing anything else to improve your health. I think people should still have computer acess, but limit the amount @MONEY1 time they spend on it a day. If people did not spend all their time online, I am sure people would not feel on issue about computers. In conclusion, computers are actually pretty they can help you and jobs, re-connect with friends and family, and look up places you are wanting to go. But also, people should be living their lives. Limit yourself on the computer thats something we can do right?",9
22,"Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers have an extremely bad effect on the people of society. Instead of getting stuck on the computer all day, we could start excersing and losing weight. We could also go to a soup kitchen and give out meals. Finally, we could save the environment from all of the electricity we use. It would benefit not only yourself, but others as well, if we did theese things.. To start, I would suggest that people stop spending so much time on the computer, and join a gym. I mean, who would want to be the one to be at home, bored, on the computer? You could be having so much more fun with your friends on the treadmill. @PERSON1 @CAPS2 from the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, states, ""The key to losing weight, is to be motivated and have fun."" You can't do that on the computer. Eating right can also impact how much weight you lose. You could learn where to eat right by going to a soup kitchen. First of all, going to a soup kitchen would help many people who need food and nutrition. I remember a time when I was going to a soup kitchen with my church. I definately didnt want to go, but, I had to. Once I got there, I really started to enjoy it. Another reason you should go to a soup kitchen, is to meet new people. It would help you to get to know them and be friendly. The most important thing to hungry people to love. If you went to a soup kitchen, you could give them that and fresher air by riding on a bike. I firmly think that going on a bike would help the environment as well as if we all turned off our computers. Studies show we use about @NUM1 kilowatts of energy a week. I we shut off our computers for only one week, it would bring that number down to @NUM2 kilowatts. I feel that the environment is an important part of the world and that we need to take care of it. If we do, it will last a lot longer. By using the computer less, there will be less polution. We won't have to waste our world or be selfish for unimportant things. In conclusion we should go to a soup kitchen excersize and turn off the computers. They are a very bad influence on america. Computers have to much of a bad effect on society.",9
23,"Although some people believe computers aren't very usefull, you'll see why they are benefits to the society. Friends and family can keep it touch. Computers are very helpful with school, work, and projects. They also help test harmful, dangerous or tricky experiments. I know tons of people who are only able to keep in touch with faraway friends or family by using computers. For example, my friend that lives here in @LOCATION1, keeps in touch with his grandmother and grandfather that lives in @LOCATION2, by using the video chat on his computer. This allows him not only to talk to his grandparents, but to see them as well! Computers also help friends to keep it touch with websites like, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, etc. The websites aren't harmful, but helpful. Friends love to use the websites to keep in touch with friends and family. Computers are also very helpful with schools, work, etc. I always use my computer when I have a project in school that I need some help on. Everyone uses computers when they would like acurate data. Computers are easier to find information for a book, and information is posted everyday. Which just shows how computers are much more up to date then books are. I'm not just saying this. This can be proven. As well as, typing up a project and printing it out for school, work, etc., is a lot neater and with the ability to spell check, gramer check, etc, on computers. You will have less mistakes on a project when you use a computer. Now, for me last opinion on computers. How would harmful chemical testing be without computers? How could we be sure our cars are running fine, and are safe to be in without computers? There are so many things that we depend on a computer to tell us is safe. Computers also help us design cars, buildings, etc. For example, say engineers are try to make a new small compact car that is safe enough to protect the drives in a @NUM1 car crash. Are the engineers going to make tons of different cars, put people in them and crash into a wall going @NUM1? No! We have the to test it on computer. Clearly, we must rethink the way we look at computers. They were made to help us. I told you how they help friends and family keep in touch from long distances I also told you how they can help you with school, work, projects, chemical testing, car testing, etc. Computers are made to help us and they always will. I see nothing wrong with the creation of computers, everyone uses it. ",11
24,"Computors are looked at as either friend or foe. I see computors and technoledges as friends not an enemy to battle against! Without the computor keeping in touch with people would be limited greatley. In schools computors help us learn different open our world so we are not just limited to places close by that people have told us about. They are truly magnificent! My best friend is moving to @LOCATION1 in two years. When she does I will have to keep in touch with her mainly by computor. Email is not only cheaper but quicker than mail. And like my friend, someone you know might live in a diferent time zone and making calls could be difficult. Computors don't only allow you to keep in touch with distant friends and reletives but also people close to you. Everyone has a scheduaule, they are a part of everyday life. Finding the time to talk to someone is difficult expesualy when their schedual never seems to match yours. You don't want to lose the freindship or cut your ties so what do you do? Email then when you can via the computor! You have time then and there and don't know when you'll have some again. That makes mailing somthing quite difficult. Life is basicly one giant schedual with empty slots for 'you' time. In this 'you' time there are many things you can do. For example, go online and look up interesting places to go around your area. After using some of your 'you' times for research you can take a day off and go somewhere as a reward for all your hard research. Things like this are very hard without the computor. You would only be able to go places you knew or heard of. Computors help you and different places with more information then you could get from one or two people. They do more than just look up places and information to make plans for just you, you could do a double team and go some place with two people who both information from their computors. Or have a whole look up information and plans for a group outing of family or your closest friends. Besides keeping in touch or making plans computors can teach you. How many times have you needed to know somthing and looked it up on the computor? You can find online dictionarys and translators for free! I've often used the computor to translate @CAPS1 to @CAPS2 and @CAPS2 to @CAPS1 for projects that we arn't expected to know words on. Working men and woman so online to go back to school while still working full time. My mom does that to set in working with preschoolers! My sister has used to the computor to look up information about colleges as she is going soon. Can't you see that computors arn't out to kill society? They are here to help you keep in touch with your greatly missed family and friends in far off places! To help you make plans for some rightly earned 'you' time, 'friend' time, and 'family' time! To give you a chance at a better job helping you learn! Can you see now how computors are here for help? Sure people missuse them but that can easily be prevented by parents keeping a close eye on their children and adults watching ther time closley.",10
25,"Dear local Newspaper, I am writing to you today to inform you, my opinion on the effect that computers has on people. I belive hthat computers has a benefial effect on people, because its up to date technology can help you learn things faster. Also, you can talk with people online all around the world, and even reconnect with old friends. Finally, computers allow you to find stuff out now faster, like sports stats and news storys. I dont know any other faster researcher ther a computer. Its like you can search for anything and find an answer for it. You can search for a recipe or baked ahska and you can actually get it in a matter of seconds. Instead of goin to the book store and buying a whole @NUM1 doller book on it. A computer is like having a book store in your living room. Also lets say your a college student studying for your mid-term, and you left your books at school, you can just go on the computer and search for what you need to study on. And bamm! There it is right in your eyes! Okay, so lets say your in school right, and your dad gets a job and you to have move far away. You don't have to worry about loseing your old friends, and contact with them. If you have a computer, you can chat with your friends anywhere. I mean like c'mon how cool is that! Your in @STATE1 chatting with your old friends back in new york! Thats pretty awesome. Also, lets say you where in high school and you and your high school sweet heart, where going strong and she away. Through the magic of the internet you can reconnect with that person and ones! Finally, your business man, and your jammed up at work with alot of meetings. You dont have time to go home and check the news. You can just go on your computer and check it from the office. You can watch the news and still have time for your @NUM2 o clock brunch, because you dident go home to see something you could in your office. Thats the beauty of it. Big sports fan, but stuck out at work and cant see the big game. But wait your bummed out for nothing because the game is at a click of a button if you watch it on your computer! You never have to miss the game again! In conclusion, i think the computer is a beniefial for people because, you can learn things way faster on it. Also because, you can chat and reconnect with old and new people. And last because, you can check the news and sports without having to leave the office!",9
26,"Dear news paper, Computers are good for people in many ways. They help us learn, just the way in school. They are helping us to learn more the just because some people don't like them doesnt mean shouldn't. After all, it is our lives. @CAPS1 do kids pay attention in school. But @CAPS1 we use the computer that's more we can learn. We can learn how to use the webcam to interact with our friends on the computer. We can do research to look up things that we do for school. Instead of learning something in school, and about it. We can read, and see a picture on video to understand it more. Computers teach us how to use more machines. We don't know what is going to be made? in the culture on how had they are going to be to use. So isn't it better if we know how to use them now? Some people don't even know how to use computer, or even cell phones. But @CAPS1 we get other cuture, that maybe a big problem. Just because some people spend all their time on the computers and don't do other things. doesn't mean we all do. I only go on the computer @CAPS1 I'm about to go to bed. But i'm out side, all day, I @CAPS2 do things with my family. So if some people have problems with computers, doesn't mean that we all do and to face the problems toward that so as I told you, computers, help us learn more thing in and even things for school. They teach us how to use things don't know gonna be in the just because some people are lazy doesnt mean we all are and have to deal with the people that do. So we should be able to use the computer without haging to deal people complaints. It is our lives.",8

Ther re positive in effecting people in more ways, such as letteing people communicate with family or friends from across the world or letting everything be easy to find what they @CAPS4 many people are people isolate and keeping them from talking to family / friends I is helping them by being to chat or type to them. People can now talk to reltives in the comfort of thre home without having to about how they look. Computer also phone bills because of call your mom in @LOCATION1 just go on I chat and chat with her, it's just @CAPS5 you can see the computers Some people also think computers give people to much access to but ther it give people the of know what they This is good for school to for look for In my fall @NUM1. or people @CAPS6 you can see computers let you find the information you the time has that @CAPS7 computers without or keeping people away from family",8
28,"Dear Newspaper. I @CAPS2 that people are spending to much time on computer. They are hurting their eyes, gaining weight, and they aren't giveing the @CAPS1 what it needs. When you stare at a computer scren your eyes cant regenerate from the brightness & all the words & pictures. Your eyes shouldn't nbe punished like this they didn't hurt you, why do you want to hurt them? @CAPS5 always told that if I stare at something for a length of time @CAPS3 eyes wont readjust to their normal self because of straining themself for so long. I realy don't @CAPS2 all of you stareing at a computer want problems. Many people who just sit around are gaining weight, and you wonder why? Maybe its bevause your not out & moving around. When you eat you gain fat cells, callories, nutrients, and alot more. But when you gain those things from the food, your body needs to prove around to help break sitting still only tells the @CAPS1 do stop and hold everything there. To break all of the things down your body needs to be moving around I dont know about you people but I try @CAPS3 best to give thing it needs to maybe this will convince you! The @CAPS1 is the most important thing in your body. You need to make sure it's getting every thing it needs maybe you @CAPS2 you are healthy but your @CAPS1 needs fresh air and nutrients from the food. Sitting in a chair or laying down does not help anything at all. I used to do the same thing a while me that if I kept sitting I playin on the computer, @CAPS3 body wont be able to work or even worse. HEART @CAPS4 or seasons. Hopefully you will listen to @CAPS3 warning, maybe people will start choosing to leave the computer & go have fun and exercise. Reasons why being on the computer too much is bad for you are that your eyes have a really hard time working. Plus your gaining weight without even knowing and your @CAPS1 needs to be taken care of needs things that you cant get from the computer all the time. So please listen to what @CAPS5 saying. It realy if important that you take care of yourself.",8
29,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers have bad effects on people, and heres why: they get less exercise, become less social with family and friends, and it is dangerous in many ways. To start, people will most likely get less exercise if they go on the computer often. For example, if you sit in front of your computer monitor all day, chances are you are going to be less prone to wanting to exercise. Also, the outdoors might not compare to what fun you can have on the computer. And lastly, people can get addicted to games that have many levels: @CAPS1 is even a website called addictinggames.com! People might not even leave the computer to get let alone get exercise. As previously stated, computers can promote bad and exercise habits, which can lead to overall bad health. Next, people can become less social due to computers. For instance, you are probably going to end up in your house like a if you go on the computer frequently. And, chances are, you're not going to want to pay attention to your cell phone if someone is trying to text or call you. That can lead to very unsocial behavior. And last, the computer could become your life. Never leaving the monitor, never going outside, and never attending social events you don't want that to happen, do you? As recently said, computers can and will promote unsocial behavior. Finally, @CAPS1 is the dangerous side of computer use. Facebook, myspace & aim people can talk to you and friend request you, and you might say no, and might say yes, but strangers can always contact you either way. People @MONTH1 not know this but if you have a facebook account for long enough, people can look up your first and last name on google and see your profile picture. Its very scary! And to finish, a lot of people these days dont know how to be safe on the computer. They'll accept a friend request even if they dont know the person as previously stated, the computer has a very and dangerous side. To sum it all up, computers promote bad fitness, a bad social life, and it is very dangerous. You wouldnt want that for the people of our town, would you?",9
30,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 name is @CAPS3 @CAPS4. I got to @ORGANIZATION1 at @CAPS5 society @ORGANIZATION1. Im at @NUM1 year old girl in the @NUM2 grade. Ive benn thinking a lot about how a lot of people who goes on the computer every single day with out doing anything interactive like playing outside with theri friends or having fun with theri families. Alot of people have probably been going on the computer so much that their addicted. ""@CAPS6"" taht is the sound of someone typing on a key board for a computer. Some people all around the world have been hooked going on computer so much that they are becoming lazy and they relly do anything to be active. Like playing a sport or even having a hobbie. I believe the most people who go on the computers the most are teens because they chatsites like @CAPS7 or @CAPS8. I go on such as @CAPS2 but I don't go on them all the time. I know going on the computer is too because you can go on it for homewroks or for projects to look something You can get pictures of someone or soemthing that your researching or type an essay. You can also you in contact with your family on online talking. Computers do teach hand-eye coordiantion because alot of students around the world have had the ability to learn about far away places before. I do believe that computer and negative effect. They say teens spends so much time But what if their homeworks and talking Their are alot of education websites for children do for . effecting on people. Like what in theri something . Some people can . So I think does benefits society if someone thinks not good that .",8
31,"Dear local newspaper, I understand that people are trying to deside whether or not being on computers is a good thing or a bad thing, and I think that this will help them make their decisions. I think that too much computer is a very bad thing because if people are sitting by their computer all day then they are not getting any exersize. And they are not enjoying nature out in the sun with their friends. One reason why too much computer is a bad thing is that people who sit on their computer all day can not get the exersize that they should be getting. Take my friend @PERSON3 for example, @PERSON3 never had a computer in his house before, he joined all of the clubs at school him and I were on the basketball team and we got a good amount of exersize every day. Now that his parents decided to buy him a computer, he quit all of his clubs and the basketball team, and now he is going obese. He is gaining many pounds every day. But @PERSON3 is not the only one with that problem. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 who are overweight are this fat because they sat by their computer all day. @PERSON1, physical tharapist has met with many obese people and talked about their problem she found out that almost all of them are obese because they do not get enough exersize because they are on the computer too much. Another reason why too much computer is bad is because they are not enjoying nature. Take my friend @PERSON2 for example, she was a great person who loved nature. But when she got her own laptop. She doesnt like to be outside anymore. I asked her if the counted to come to the nature with me and she said that she has a vertual park. on her computer. I tried to tell her that it was not as good as real nature but she said it was better. @PERSON2 isnt the only one with this problem. @PERCENT2 of @CAPS1 lack nature in their lines if they have a computer. Would you realy only want @CAPS1 to sit at home on their computers rather then enjoy nature? These reasons are why I think that people are getting way too much computer time, they are not getting enough exersise and they are not in the nature with friends enough.",9
32,"People are or not computers benefit society. Some say that computers are an advancement on technology. I believe that computers are a most of time. People are spending more line on the computer than with family in members and friends. They are spending more time on the computer than exercising, and are not enjoying nature. Computers we just way people to become lazy. When computers out they because for more people to spend their family members and friends. Instead of playing a board games with their family kids and adults just go on the computer to play a game. Computers take away people can be spending with their friends. Now all people do is spend time talking to their friends online instead of playing outside. spending time with this people spend time with family members and friends because of . Researchers say that computers away from the time could be people on the . people the computer typing or playing . There now have jobs computer. Thus can people good . Enjoying a big of peoples lives along. Now you can just nature online rather than going outside and a pictures computers the ability to out pictures. People spend more time on the computer than outside. Nature to people . They would be on the computer. Computers are a big time. Any thing you finding computer you could find somewhere else. Computers away people. Spending time with and enjoying nature",8
33,"Dear Newspaper, I realize that you are going to make an article on using computers. I personally disagree with the statement that computers are good for you. People are spending too much time on their computers. Internet safty issues, the effecs of computer. My first reason is that people are spending way too much time on computers I know many friends that spend about half the day @CAPS1 and @CAPS2. Satistics show that one out of every @NUM1 child in the @LOCATION1 is spending at least @NUM1 hours everyday on the computer. That's a lot of kids that show there time on the computer. They could be doing many other things during their time. They could be hanging out with frends at the mall or go to another friends because they could be doing fun activities with their parens and siblings. Also insted of sitting around and not doing anything the entire day the person could so ours and play sports like tennis, soccer and other fun athletic spends. If kids would exercise more in the @LOCATION2 we wouldn't have as many fur people as he. Another reason is the problem with internet safty. For example if you have an embarrasing of yourself from @CAPS3 grade and of your friends find it. He or she might post it on his or her facebook account. Then a school bully might see it and starts to tell other kids in your schoool about it through facebook. Those people might start your at school because of it. Another example is that you @MONTH1 have had a bad day in school an freinds, but then you friends stand insalty you. My final reuson is that using a computer for the work could change the you. If you use a computer for a certain amount of time for the right reasons that might be good for your grade, but if you are playing games and with the time of doing your homework or studying your grade with drop. That could effect your future. I think parents should monitor the actions children are taking online because you could prevent child for a grade class. If the parens have set a schedule where the  kidcould have a certan amount of time games or chat online their would be. I think that computers are not good for our society, People spend too much time on the computer. Instance of doing other things you never know what could be happen. Online games using a computer to play games too much might effect your grade. You should tell parent to computer use.",9
34,"Dear, @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS4 how things work @CAPS1, I am writing a local letter I agree that technology @CAPS4 useful because without technology there @CAPS4 no way we can email or talk or text. Take a phone for an example A phone @CAPS4 good. It has technology and you can text. That @CAPS4 talking to @CAPS2 @CAPS4 @MONTH1 occur. The effects of technology @CAPS4 that technology @CAPS4 way more handson network and that means that technology, you can email faster than have to type up all the hard work and so when you can do it than everybody can do it too @CAPS3 a result i think that technology @CAPS4 a good thing. Therefore I have set my point. And I think that @CAPS4 all so you should have been good technology or technology shall come to you.",5
35,"Dear ""The @CAPS1"" I agree with your theory that people spend to much time on the computer, true, you can learn vast knoledge about far away people and places. But if someone were to discover something magnificent, and think ""oh my, I have to create a web page describeing this wonderful place,"" they, at one point in time said ""I should write a book about this"" what I am getting at is that i do not believe that there is anything that is on the internet that we do not have documented in books, the internet can be used for bad purposes, like stalking people, and potential crimes, for example, @CAPS2, people take @CAPS3 quizes and are sometimes giving there password and private information away to strangers. People are also not spending enough time enjoying life if they are cooped up in there house, on the computer. I wanted to hang out with my friend once, he lives in a rural area, and he said it was to cold. It's @NUM1 and I live by the water, you know what he practically said? ""@CAPS4 thanks I wanna sit here and let my life waste away in front of a computer"" People can become so obsesive with electronics these days, the computer is another excuse not to call up your friend, and ask to meet for lunch or a cup of coffee, that is the purpose of computers, but in some cases a computer can be good, and used for good purposes, you can do things that we used to not be able to before computers. I was shown a doctoral website, to show you how to do a knee replacement surgery, and many other kinds of surgerys. They have online @CAPS5 and other animal disections, all these things that could not be accessable without computers, instead of having to drive to work each @CAPS1 and use gasoline, you can work straight from home! So it makes it possible to spend time with your family, set your hours so you can enjoy life, the way life is meant to be spent. But there must be balance, if you want to work at home, you shouldn't spend all your time at home, you need to go out, take a walk, walk your dog(s) or you can hang with a friend! If you live in a city go shopping! Don't spend your life, or most of it locked up in your house, online or not having fan. Those are my thoughts. The internet is used for bad things sometimes, computers can be very addictive, and they can be used for good in some cases, as you can see, or tell, I'm mutual about the internet, those are my opinions, I hope you enjoyed and got a lot out of long paper.",9
36,"Dear @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1 the @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 all @CAPS3 have or more computer. They are used for communication, games and to type reports. But computers have more uses. They can be used to medical research, to improve are environment and to create means @ORGANIZATION1 transportation. Computers, I believe, would be hard to live without. They are used in almost everything. Computer are too valuable to our society; we connect rid @ORGANIZATION1 them. Work in the @ORGANIZATION1 has been impacted by computers significantly. When the computer was introduced robots were disigned to deliver redication to different rooms. There as computers advanced, robots could perform precise surgirirs. Computer also helped the medical industry when they started looking at @ORGANIZATION2. With computers, can see happened @CAPS6 a genetic mutation. Dr. @ORGANIZATION1 recalls. ""The patient had a small bump on his arm. The computer the tissue taken from the . We had the tissue by hand and found nothing wrong. But the computer found a disease."" @CAPS4, people are saved by computers. COmputers are also useful when studying the weather. They have been key in studying global warming environmental scientist has. Computers can continuously record weather patterns and wind speeds. A human would sit next to an instrument a chart and log the reading. Because @ORGANIZATION1 human ever, the recordings would be off. So, the computer is more accurate. Computers in satelites can take pictures @ORGANIZATION1 ice cops. They automatically how fast the ice is melting, and @CAPS6 the speed @ORGANIZATION1 the melting is constant, it can when all @ORGANIZATION1 the ice will be gas. Without computers, environmental studies would be an science. Transportation is also enriched by computers. I remember when my class learned about. We heard bridge that collapsed due to post designing. When wind the blew, bridge could not support that live lead. With computers, bridge engineers can build bridges electronically. Then, they can use simulaters to put forces on the bridge, like traffic, wind and . Shamal @CAPS5 says, ""@CAPS6 this technology had been used to desing that , the would have saved @MONEY1, and @NUM1 lives."" Technology also made cars safer. Traction control and brakes are all controlled by the car's computer. The car can also sense what temperature the inisde is and adjusts to your . So you can have a comfortable ride. Computers are so useful. They are used @CAPS4 in transpotation, the medical field, and in global studies. Without the computer, our society will take a huge step backwards. ",11
37,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 this as a front page n fad line: ""@CAPS4 suffers from brain damage due to computers!"" computers are a growing phenomenon in the world and each year newer, more advances models are being produced. This, however, doesn't benefit our society like you might think! Due to computers, poeple spend less time excersizing, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends, family, and other citizens. For these reasons, I believe that computers hurt, more than help, our community. To start, people spend far too much time on the computer. Weather it is shopping, playing games, watching movies or even working-it takes up valuable time that could be spent getting exersize! With the growth of computers, obisity issues have grown in the @LOCATION2 as well. Just this year, the @ORGANIZATION1 reported that about three in every five @CAPS5 are overweight. That is a groteque amount of people! on the sublect of @ORGANIZATION1, it has also been discovered that computers can cause eye and brain damage. @PERSON2 helmeg stated, ""@CAPS6, people are spending far too much time on the computers. With not as much exposure to the outdoors and other sources, people are causing long term damage to their eyes and certain regions of their brains."" @CAPS7, as a nation, need to get off the computer and go excersize! In addition to the lack of excersize in our nation due to computers, citizens are not spending as much time enjoying nature. People need fresh air in order to stay healthy! Not only does the outdoors provide fresh air though, but it is a source of beauty and knowledge. Grant @PERSON1, a local senior said. ""I remember my childhood as always being outside. I was never inside longer than absolutely necessary, unlike these days. I learned a lot from the outdoors and it has definatly helped me in life."" @PERSON1 presented a good point too. Having knowledge of the outdoors should be basic common knowledge to everybody in our society. Due to computers thought, the beauty, knowledge and importance of nature is being overlooked and not stressed as much in our country and community. Furthermore, computers create issues with the amount and kind of interaction humans get with one another. On computers, there are many online was to talk weather it is via email, instant message, or video chat, these forms of communication are destroying future generations. This is so because behind a computer, people feel safe. They feel that they can say or act in whatever manner they so choose. This not only leads to bullying, but it can affect the way children and adults interact in person. A recent study conducted by the @CAPS1 youth and family services organization showed that @PERCENT1 of kids are more comfortable communicating with peers on the computer rather than in person. That is a very large amount. If @CAPS7 don't change our use of computers soon, @LOCATION1's future generations could have a huge issue on their hands. All in all, computers have a negative effect on both individuals and our society as a whole. Computers cut into much needed excersize time, limit people's appreciation and exposure to nature, and interfere with social interaction. The next time you support computer use or find yourself logging hours infront of the screen, think of the negative results that occur! Finally, I vehemently improve you to stand up against the over-use of computers in our society and take a stand! Thank you for your consideration to my thoughts.",10
38,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 position on weather or not computers are good or bad for you is that I agree that they are good for you in someways, for example they teach-hand eye coodination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people,and even allow people to talk online with others. @CAPS2 first explanation is that they teach-hand eye coordination. Computers are good for that because they can be used to teach up or even @NUM1, @NUM2, @NUM3, and @NUM4 year olds how to count, spell, read, it can also teach you how to type, paint, and design on your computer. Next theres how they give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. Manily most adults use the computer to search for where they had grown up and what type of life they had, if it was a difficult or easy life. They also search for there private getaway or for a family vacation to @LOCATION1 or to @LOCATION2. However most people dis-agree with me bacause most parents are afraid that there teenagers @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not put innapropriate pictures online or @MONTH1 even go on @CAPS3 for example and your child could be talking to a rapist or a sexual abuser that might be lying just to come to your front door and rape you and then kill you. Well to make sure that that never happens to lock inapporiate websites such as @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5 or any other inappropiate website. Last but not least computers also allow people to talk online with othe people. Most teenagers use there comptuer for this also they basically only use it for chat with their friends and/ or even use it to know whats been goin on lately. Most teenagers use @CAPS6 or @ORGANIZATION1 which are basically the samething, most parents dont allow their children to use those websites but there wrong with @CAPS6 and @ORGANIZATION1 because know rapist or sexual abuser can add you unless they know your screen which makes it impossible for them to add you. Also when you have @CAPS6 or @ORGANIZATION1 you can give your screen name to your friends which they can then add you. You can also block a person when you dont know them.",8
39,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3: @CAPS4 up because what I have to say is extremlly important I am a firm believer that computers have negative effects on people. My first reason why I believe computers have a negative effect on people is because people aren't getting the proper amount of exercise. My second reason why computers have a negative effect on people is because people are going to perminatly damge their eys. My @CAPS7 reason why computers have a negative effect on people is because people aren't spending enough time with their family and friends. In case you @CAPS2't notice, I strongly believe computers have negitive effect on people. My first reason why compuers have a negative effect on people is because people aren't getting enough exercise. People are sitting at home on the computer for the day instead of getting their much needed exercise. Another thing is that the @LOCATION1 has a large amount of obice people living here, so the last thing they need is another exscuse for them not to get their exercise. Stats prove that since computers became increasingly popular, the number of obice people has risen @PERCENT1 from @PERCENT2 to @PERCENT3. As you can see, I believe computers are makeing people spend less time exercising. My second reason why computers have a negative effect on people is because it is doing perminant damge to their eys. I say this because people sit, on average, @NUM1 feet from their screen. Also, the amount of time spent looking at the screen from so close ranges from @NUM2 hours a day. Dr. @PERSON1, an eye doctor who graduated from @CAPS5, says, "" @CAPS6 this amount of time spent on the computer a day is malntained, then by the year @DATE1 their will be a signifigant increase in the amount of blind people. My @CAPS7 reason why computers have a negative effect on people is because they're not spending enough time with their family and friends. I say this because rather than go spend time with your loved ones, people decide it is more important to constintlly check their facebook. For example, instead of going to a family picnic, you decide you have a fantasy football draft in a little while so you skip the picnic. Another thing is that sitting on the computer all day instead of interatcting with your love ones can cause you to loose contact with them and be left all alone. As you can see I strongly believe computer have a negative rather than a positive effect on people because; they cause you to loose exercise, damage your eyes, and they cause you to loose contact with your loved ones. Thank you for taking the time to read my letter.",9
40,"Dear local newspaper, I agree that people do spend more time on computers than actually doing there studies or even excercising. Also people do spend to much time on computers than they normally spend interacting with there own family an friends. I personally think that people should actually spend more time with there own family an friends more than be on the computers on the time also maybe parents should only let students have a certain amount of time because if students get everything they want all they gona do is always be on the computer. Another reason why people should not use computers so much is because the computers could also be so warned out because people be on them to much. Also on a labtop if it get to hot it can catch on fire. Also if you use the computer so much at a time you can get viruses an then your computer will break i think people spend to much time on computer because maybe there family is not the perfect family there maybe be some problems in a family maybe thats all people wanna do is be on a computer. Maybe a computer is a person's best friend. But then again people could get blind from looking at the screens so much.",7

42,"Dear Newspaper, I strongly support advances in technology. Not only does a computer help teach hand-eye coordination, but helps others goin knowledge too. It even allows you to interact with others who live far away from you. Most people say sports help people learn hand-eye coordination. Not as many people know that typing does too. Maybe not the @NUM1 - finger crawl, but if people take the time to learn to type correctly, then their aim should improve greatly. This is only one great asset to a computer. If you live here in the @LOCATION2, you probaly don't know much about places like @LOCATION1. To find information on this ice-covered country most people hit the computer. Typing ""@LOCATION1"" on search engines like ""@CAPS1"" is much quicker than paging through dozens of books. You could find the same information with just one click. Sure computers help with hitting the next soft ball, or acing your next history paper. But, what about family or friends who have moved away? Computers can help with that to. Some people fear that kids, and even adults, are spending too much time on the computer. Not enough with family or friend. But, you can connect with them still. Wether it be with someone states away or someone who lives down the street, e-mail and instant messageing servers can help you contact them quickly. I think others should see how important computers can be to daily life. They help teach hand-eye coordination, are quick to find information you need and, help keep close relationship with people who aren't around.",8
43,"@ORGANIZATION1, In a recent survey, it was discovered that @NUM1 out @NUM2 household in @LOCATION1 own one or more computers. While computers help us look up information more efficiently, they also have negative impacts on ar lives. Computers badly affect humans because they worsen students' academic performance, can be dangerous,a nd make people less healthy. First of all, computers can damage students' education. While computers are helpful to search for information, they can also be abused. Not all websites are appropriate and if a child is supposed to be typing an essay or something, they can easily get distracted on th internet playing games. This can result in a student's grades lowering because they spent more time foolinf arand on the internet than searching for facts relating to a topic in school. Also, students will not learn how to search things the old-fashioned"" way, such as looking for a book in the library using the @ORGANIZATION2. Clearly, computers do more harm than good regarding students' education. Moreover computers can expose people to dangers... With all of the social networking sites nowadays, including @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and instant messaging, it is much easier to contact strangers. My friend @CAPS3-@CAPS4 once went into a chatroom on the computer and began to unknowingly talk to an internet predator. He found out her name and address and came to her house and tried to hurt her. All of this would not have happened if she hadn't entered that chatroom. Even people you know that @MONTH1 not like you can cyber stalk you. As you can see, @CAPS5 information about people is so much easier with computers and some people will abuse that advantage. Additionally, by using computers, people become less healthy. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS6 said that they are less physically active since they bought a computer. This is because with a computer, you do not need to leave your house to find information or be entertained. Instead of walking to the to the library to borrow a book or playing a sport for fun, all you have to do is @ORGANIZATION3 information about a topic or play games online. Furthermore, your eyesight will worsen by by starting at a bright computer screen for hars everyday. By having computers, people's social health also worsen. Instead of having to talk to people face-to-face, you can instant message people. With out a doubt, computers harm yar health physically and socially. In conclusion, computers do not benefit people because students' education is damaged, people can be put in dangerous situations, and yar health can decline. Computers pose as a distraction to students, internet predators can contact you, and you get less physical excersize. I hope you realize that computers do more harm than good.""",11
44,"Dear Newspaper, ""Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people."" Computers definitely have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, have easy access to information, and at the same time can have fun, and be social. Computer's most definitely should not be a huge concern. Computer's are a big part with helping with hand-eye coordination. If you are playing a game on a i-@CAPS1 and the goal is @NUM1 lap the bubbies that pop up, than the computer will have made it easier is, bubbies quicker. When you are actually on a computer, you can see and tap the keys on the keyboard quicker because of the better hand-eye coordination you have from computers. Another example is if you are in a rush to leave, as soon as you yhour car keys, grab them quicker. This is because of the hand-efe coordination that was improved from computers. This is not the only way computer back effect on people. Computers give easy access to information. For example, if you need to research information on another. Country for homework, than you can your question this a search engine. Also if you are wondering about the lyric can song, you can type in www.lyrics.com into the internet and they will give you the lyrics needed the . If you are in a debate with family about whether or not @CAPS2 is the capital of @LOCATION1, than you can type the question into a search engine. Computers do more than access information easily. With computers, you can also have fun and of social. A way to be social is cheating with an old friend from camp, or from school on www.facebook.com. If you want enteratinment than you can go on www.youtube.com and watch your new and favorite music videos such as @CAPS3 @CAPS4 by @CAPS5, or @CAPS6 @CAPS6 @CAPS6 by @NUM2. If the weather is bad outside, you can always go on www.miniclip.com, to play games. Compters are used for many different reasons; more than just fun and being social. Computers do many things such as help with hand-eye coordination easy access to information, and run and social purposes. Computers have a very positive effect. The only issue is overdosing! the time spend on the computer. If you mange your time wisely so than you do other physical activities, than computers are fantastic!",10
45,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I believe that computers have a positive effect on society. In one little machine there is so much you can do. There are ways to communicate with others and even learn new ideas. The computer really is a benefit. One way the computer is a good invention is that it gives people a chance to do things they wouldn't normally experience. For example if a person wanted to see a picture of @LOCATION1, all they would have to do is type it into a search engine. Also, it makes many tasks simpler for people. Typing on @ORGANIZATION1 is much faster than writing out a letter. Plus, all the information you need is right at your fingertips. Not only is a way to learn. Like I mentioned before, the search engine is a useful computer tool. BY typing a key @ORGANIZATION1 onto the screen, lots of information is accessible. Why would anyone take the time to look through a book when it could take five seconds on the computer? Besides having an infinite amount of information, the computer can give an education. Many people today can't afford to attend a college. The computer makes it easier by giving them online courses so they can work during the day. This helps a hardworking person receive the education they deserve. Another way the computer is beneficial to our society is it makes communication easier. For instance, say a student got a detention and his teacher wanted his parents to know. Instead of mailing a letter which could take days, all the teacher would have to do is send an email. You might say, ""@CAPS2't the teacher call?"" @CAPS3 could but what if the student's parents aren't home? EMail is fast and can arrive at it's destination in under a minute. Another way people communicate on the computer is through sites like @CAPS4 and @CAPS5. Each person is able to set up their own profile and look for people they know. With this ability, one person can find people they had met twenty years ago. It's a great way to reconnect with old friends and talk with current ones. In one little box, people can do so much. Life is made easier through programs like email and @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1. We are able to do things like go to college, from the privacy of our own homes and communicate and share pictures with old and new freinds. The computer is a machine that effects mankind in a good way.",9
46,"Computers @MONTH1 be helpful at some times, but they are taking too much valuable time from peoples lives. When people are bored, instead of going outside or doing something productive, they decide to go on the computer. Everything that you do on the computer can be done off of it. Plus, computers @MONTH1 be part of why people are obese. Also, as much as you can talk to friends online it will help you be more social if you didn't talk over the internet. There is more to life that what is on computers. Computers are an easy shortcut to finding the things you desire. Looking for facts for your history project? Go to the library. People in the past didn't have computers, yet they were still smart. You can learn hand-eye cooordination by playing sports, too. Then, you would get your exercise along with it. Although I do agree that is easier to get in touch with people that live far away, you could still do that over the phone. Having trouble with your math homework? Instead of looking up how to do it, like I know I've done many times, go get help from your friend and make a study session. There are plenty of ways to do things that you thought you couldn't do without the computer. How many times have you been on the computer even when it was a beautiful day outside. The computer @MONTH1 be interesting is the world around you. Our obese people percent is becoming larger and larger. I think the computer @MONTH1 be contributing some to this percent. People don't go out for a walk or bike ride as much as they used to. Instead they stay inside and do things like going on the computer. People need exercise to stay healthy. You can't get the exercise you need if you are on the computer. The computer is limiting your social interaction with your peers. Of course on the computer you can talk to them. But, you should be hanging out with them in person. This would boost your social life and let you have fun and enjoy being with friends all at the same time. My friend once told me that sometimes she didn't want to hang out one day even when she had nothing to do. So, she went on the computer. I once read a story in which a girl loved watching tv and because of tv she forgot what she liked and didn't spend as much time doing the things she used to. This is the same as with a computer. People get sucked into them and don't do all the fun things they could be doing like spending time with friends or family. I think that although computers @MONTH1 be helpful sometimes you shouldn't make them a big part of your life. Try to do things without the help of a computer. Go out and get fit and in shape. And, spend less time on the computer and more time outside enjoying your life with friends and family. You can have a life without computers, so go and live it.",10
47,"Yes, computers are benefits for society. One they help people such as finding stuff in the enternant. Two computers are etertaining. Last but not least you do whatever you want with it. My first reason was that they help people. I said that because they help people find stuff in the enternant. For example it's good for people to do their homework. Like a project or essay. You could comunicat with family of friends that are away from you like @CAPS1.R. or @LOCATION1. My second reason was that their entertaining. The reason I choose this reason was because computers are good for games and more. For example you sould find games such as racing games or sport games if your into tehm. It has different kinds of games. They also have cool websites. For example @CAPS2.com @CAPS3.com and all sorts of websites. My final is that you could do whatever you want with it. By that I mean that you could got to websites like @CAPS4 thatr you talk to people. Print pictures out for wotk or school work. Anything you want with it, its yours!

Technolgy is bad with @CAPS4 you won't get exercise, but without @CAPS4 you can go out and see nature on vaction and hikes. You can go on far away vacations have fun and exersice like going to the beach and swimming or walking. Also if you go on hikes you will see the buety of nature and you get get exercise. A lot of people today don't go out much because of the computers and get fat so a hike will help them a lot. Computers has a down side because people get addicted to them all the time and get lazy and fat. Nature can get you some ware in life like you can love @CAPS4 and try to save @CAPS4 cause you love @CAPS4 so much. Another thing people could instead of playing with the computer is play a sport. There is a sport for everyone out there to do no matter what @CAPS4 is. Also you can be a dare devil and do crazy stunts like jump a canyon or something like that. A lot of people are that use computer and are still in shape so a lot of people that like computers can do that. Another thing is that people love to talk to each other and its not bad to go on a computer once in a while but all the time is very bad for you. Also the people that love there computers don't meet a lot of people at all unless they have friends. In the world today so many people play sports all the time wether its @CAPS5 or football you are still geting active. To sum @CAPS4 all up computers are bad because they don't give you exersice.

Computars can teach people hand eye coordination which is a very useful in the real world because lots of jobs you to use your hands. Most jobs that envole tecnolegy, its good to have hand eye coordination, but to have good hand eye coordination you'll need practice and some people might become obsessed with the computer and never come off while there practicing there coordination which might led them to forget about important things in life like these family but the easy way to fix that is by giving yourself a get time to be on the computer and that shoud never happen. This nis how hand eye coordination is good and how it won't let you lose track of important things in your life. Also computars can be a good learning expercience, they can teach you about far away places like the collisum in @LOCATION4 or the @LOCATION2's of @LOCATION1 and even the @LOCATION3 rain forest and the tribes that live there. Also the computar can help you book flights so you can go to these wonderful places, plus if you go to these places you'll get a serious workout because you'll be out exploring so you don't got fat and unhealthy from sitting at the computar all day lastly I want to say that the computar can teach you about far away and give you a lote of back on them too. this is another reason how the computer can benifit us. Lastly the computar ca allow to have a long distance conversation with people. talking with people, even one's around the world is good because everyone needs to talk to someone now and then, yet sometimes talking can get out hand which what I mean is you'll be on for so long that you'll forget what the outside of your room look's like and what nature is, like I said talking can be good but don't do it every day for the rest of your life because its good to go out for, enjoy nature, even garden this why the computar is good for communication not just because you can talk to you @CAPS1 penpal but so you can learn more about the cultures os the world. That is why the computar is a good and important part of our socity, it can teach us hand eye coordination, teach us about for away places, and even let us talk to people that are on the other part of the globe that why the computars is good even though it can com some our lives but there past that, that is why the computar is important to our society.",9
50,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2; I am writing to you for the debate on wether computers help or break people down. I do think they break use down but they do help us in so many ways. On a computer most people will think about going on websites of games. There is more to it than that. Our technology is so advanced that people who use computers can talk via text chat online or a live webcam chat, they make it so we dont always have to drive somewhere and waste gas. The following paragraphs will show why computers are great to use. The way we take care of ourselves. If most people eat and eat constantly what good does that do for them? They need to know @CAPS4 they need to excercise and should do it daily. People do get addicted to computers but that doesnt meen they cant excercise. This @MONTH1 sound weird but @CAPS4 we type a lot of fact we build strength in our hand-eye cordination. The internet also could teach us new ways to exercise not just us running around. Our hands actually get stronger @CAPS4 we type due to the amount of times we use them constantly @CAPS3, @CAPS3 is an excercise. Secondly a computer can prepare kids for future carrers in offices, @CAPS4 we type we memorize where the keys are so soon enough we can not even look at the keyboard @CAPS4 we type. We can also use computer and take college classes and graduate through the internet for people who cant aford to go to a college university. The internet is a great resource for many things, one of the things is to learn another language so you can communicate with other people around the world. We can also learn how to do things due to website youtube. You can upload anything on the website and become viral over the internet and show off you own content. The internet has websites that can help you select future jobs, display you own stuff, or just view many things. Last but not least the internet has websites like facebook that will let you interact with your friends or family members who accept a request from so you never meet any strangers or can get harmed either way. Its a easier way to communicate father than driving to meet someone or hogging the house phone. The computers come with so many features that make everyone who uses a computer a lot easier to use. They now make touchsmart computers and wireless mouses. A computer is not just for us to have fun on. It teaches us subjects in depth. Its great to have a computer because you can learn about different subjects, you can interact with other people around the world, or you can prepare youreself. for a future job. Computers are not bad at all they do things for us that we could never think of computer are great to own.",10
51,"I think that computers have a positive effect on people. I say this because they help out a lot. They have many diffrent capabilities. Read on to find more on why I think that computers have a positive effect. My first reason is that people can communicate with friends they havent seen in a long time. This is a good thing because if you lost contact with a friend you could find him on the internet. Also you can keep touch with friends and family if they go to far places to see to see how they're doing. Lastly, you can keep in contact with pepole you havent seen in years. This is why I think that computers have a positive effect on people. My @CAPS1 reason is you can write stuff and type it into the computer. I think this is good because what if a person has messy handwritting and they have to write something for their job. They can just type it into the computer and and print it and it out neat. Also you can send letters to through the computer. This is another reason why I think that computer a positive effect on people. You should agree with me on this. My last reason uis that if you have a computer you can actually play games that can make you think faster and you can also by things of the internet instead of going to be store. Like if the store ran out of the thing you wanted you could buy it online and stil got it on time. Ang the gmaes @CAPS2 talking about are mind games and prizes that make think harder. Also you actually go to college through the computer. These are my final reasons that i think computers have apositive effect on people. I think you should agree with me and I hope you will computers have a positive effect on people. I dont really se a negative effect that comes out of them. Accept for when hackeers try to hack into your computer. so agree with me and my reason on how computers have a positive effect on people.",8
52,"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. In my opinion, I think computers do benefit society. For an example, if you need to know of search for something you can look it up. The computer most likely will have what you're looking for (@CAPS1 search engine is @ORGANIZATION1). You can keep in touch with a person no matter how far away. Also, being on the computer doesn't have to take time away from nature and family. First of all, there's so much knowledge on a computers. It has mostly every topic you can think of. This can benefit in various ways. For an example, if you want to know about a medical issue/problem, you can find it. People that are in school no matter what grade, it helps if you look up the subject to get numerous resources. Over all, probably one of the most common things to do on the computer is shopping. Instead of leaving your home, mostly every greatly known store has their own website. Sometimes, even minor stories have a website. Computers are great in knowledge and searching. Secondly, computers are great to communicate, @CAPS2 someone @MONTH1 live a very for distance from where you are, you can always keep in touch. There's chat rooms, webcam, email, networking sites, and more all over the web. Why keep adding to your phone bill, using your minutes, or hope for a signal when you could just use the simple computer? computers are a smart way to communicate. Lastly, computers aren't the ones who take time away from family, exercise, or enjoying nature. The amount of time used on the computer is up to you. It doesn't have to be an everyday thing using the computer nor does interacting with family. Exercising, and enjoying nature. You could always fit in time for both or you could just use the computer when you necessarily need to. Using the computer doesn't harm your time with family, exercise, and nature. In conclusion, in my strong opinion, I think a computer benefits society. Computers can be used for search engines for knowledge and shopping/bargaining. They're also great for communication. Lastly, computers never really take time from your family and friends, exercise, or nature. That's all up to you. Therefore, I see that computers really benefit society rather than waste it.",9
53,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion about the effects of computers on people is that computers have good effects on people. One reason is computers have good effects on people because when you need to look something up online for home work. Another is that computers have good effects on people because if you want to chat or talk with a friend online you can if you have a computer. Lastly if you are going on vacation and you need directions to go to the place you want to got you. Just look them up. First, computers have good effects on people because when you need to look something up online for homework. If you try finding something online like a definition for a word you will find it. If we did not have computers we would not be able to find things for homework that easy. We would have to look through a lot of books just to find it. Second, computers have good effects on people because if you wan't to chat or talk with your friend online you can if you have a computer. You can ask your friend what your homework was if you forgot. If you were absent from school on like a @DATE1 you can ask a friend online what you missed in class and what they did in school while you were gone. Finnaly, if you are going on vacation and you need directions to go to the place. Were you want to go to you can just look them up. If you look them up you will find directions really fast. It's better to look up directions because you will not get lost. If you don't look them up you will got lost. @CAPS1 opinion is that the effects of computers on people is good one reason @NUM1's that computers have good effects on people because when you need to look something up online for home work. Another is that if you want to chat or talk with one of your friends online you can if you have a computer. Lastly, if you are going on vacation and you need directions to where you want to go you can just look them up. That's why I think computers have a good effect on people.",8
54,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 is quite obvious that computers are in fact a benefit for the society, and they are convenient when keeping in touch, but in my opinion, computers are beginning to have a negative effect on people. They are affecting people mentally, physically, and they're also having an impact on people's safety. People need to unplug the hard drive and start living life unplugged. We've all heard the term before, a 'couch potatoe!' @CAPS2 pretty much the same for a computer except a 'desk potatoe'. When people use the computer @CAPS1 has various negative physical effects on them. The more time people spend online, the less they can excersise, play outside and just enjoy nature. Computers keep people from going outside and excersising. The more computers we use, the bigger we're going to get. You're not gonna burn any calories sitting on the couch with your laptop. You can only get so much excersise from typing or moving a mouse. @CAPS1 also effects you physically when @CAPS1's pulling you away from your friends. Most @MONTH1 say you can still stay in touch with facebook, or myspace, but is that really friendship? You can't make any plans to do anything with your buds if all you're doing is sitting at the computer. Computers are having a negative effect on people's physical health. You know the term addicted right? @CAPS2 when there's one thing you cannot stop thinking about. That one thing that's always on your mind. This addiction is common when @CAPS1 comes to computers and technology. All day, all you can think about is getting a message on facebook or adding more tweets to your twitter. You are dependent on the website and technology. First thing you do when you get home is turn on your laptop. Computers are effecting people's imental health as well. They seem addictive. We've all been warned haven't we. Peop come to give speeches about @CAPS1, schoold constantly ramble abut @CAPS1 and that thing in internet awareness or sacety. Everyday, more than @NUM1 predators turn on their computers just searching for their next victims. This is a very serious negative effect that computers have on people. @CAPS1 seems so easy for one to fall in the trap of an internet predator. All @CAPS1 takes is one friend request, and they have a chance of you being their next victim. But predators are not the only things there's also virus. Virus all start with a ""@CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1."" @CAPS1 is an ad or a saying you'll win a free ipod or something. And once you click on that @ORGANIZATION1, they're got you. Put in some personal information, they've got you even more. Virus and scams like that are major disadvantages to having a computer. So without internet awareness, your safety could be effected. Computers aren't having the best effect on people. @CAPS1 affects your physical and mental health, along with bad effects on your safety. @CAPS2 time for @CAPS5 to smash the hard drive and trash the laptops, then get outside and enjoy life, computer free.",11
55,"Dear The @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 you want your children spending all day, everyday on the computer rather than spending time with you? I sure wouldn’t like that! Spending too much time on the computer can get you in trouble. It can also strain you eyes from staring at the screen. Also, you want get any exercise while on the internet. I'm writing this letter to convince you that spending all day on the computer does not benefit society. First of all, many kids in middle school and high school have myspaces or facebooks. If you spend all day on those websites you can get into a lot of trouble. Kids dont realize what they type can be available to anyone. They should be aware of what they're typing, but just to make sure, the parents should monitor them. Many people spend all day on the computer talking to friends and end up using inappropriate language. This can get them into a lot of trouble so they are better off spending time with family and friends. Do you the fact of having wear glasses fromstaring at a computer? Many people dislike glasses and if they stare at the computer screen, especially at night, they eventually will need them. Even switching from screen to screen and playing games hurts my eyes! If you staring at your computer screen. If it gets so bad, maybe glasses won't even help. Even though chatting with friends & family, playing games and watching videos on @CAPS2 is fun, you don't want to be a couch potatoe and gain weight. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 teens said that they knew a friend/family member who doesn't exercise at all and is always on the computer. If we prove that you won't be healthy after a week of computer, this ratio will go down by a lot. Enough of the @ORGANIZATION2's or videos about losing weight, just get off the computer and do fun activities outside! This @CAPS1 be great if we can stop people from gaining weight without surgery, medication, or videos, right?! I suggest you have an article on how computers can affect your weight and it's not good for you. In conclusion, I believe that looking/being on a computer all day will not hurt yourself, but hurt you family & friends. It'll help you stay out of trouble, be glassless, and be very energetic and healthy. Being on the computer and in a while is okay but not @NUM3. It's sort of like the cellphone now.",10
56,"Dear, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I believe that computers have a great effect on people. One reason I think that is because if you are a loner, a computer can make you have friends. Second reason if you are bored you can go on a learning site on the computer. And the third reason computers will keep you upgraded. Computers have websites that you can meet people on like @CAPS3, facebook, and twitter. If you are a loner and really just need a friend the computer can get you that. Also if you start to talk to people on the computer you never know they could turn out to be that special someone in your life. Computers are a also great learning tool it has websites that can teach you math, social studies, @LOCATION1, and science. Also the computer is a tool its self if you know how to use a computer that can help you in the long-run if you need a job. I say that because now an days you need a computer for some jobs so if you know how to work a computer your good to go. Also if you want to be cool like your kids and not feel left out a computer is the way to go. Computers are so upgraded everyone either wants one or has one. And if you were always lefft out or for some reason felt that way @CAPS4 tellin you set a computer. Now I hope you read this carefully because computers will put a smile on any ones face. Always remember computers have websites you can meet people on also they have great learning sites and last but not least you will be upgraded. That is all I have to say for now.",7
57,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 do you find out what's happening all over the world, or find answers to your urgent questions? The @ORGANIZATION1 can help you do this and more. With computers, people can quickly find the information they need, discover what's going on in the world, and connect to others. Computers have greatly benefited us. I can't tell you @CAPS1 many times I've used the computer to @ORGANIZATION1 for school. You can find out almost anything online. Are you concerned whether your headaches are serious? You can find out what your symptoms mean without having to leave the room. Do you need advice? There are people all over the world who can help you. You can also get information quickly. Just search what you want, click a link, and you're there. Computers allow people to easily get information. @CAPS1 would you know if there was an earthquake in @LOCATION1? You have to wait to watch the news, but on the @ORGANIZATION1, you can find out what happened in half an hour. According to @PERSON1, of the @ORGANIZATION1, major events such as a disaster or a celebrity's death, for example, are mostly posted online within an hour and a half. People can also learn about minor events that wouldn't be on the news, but are important to them. I was not able to attend the most recent @CAPS2 dancing championship, but I found out @CAPS1 my friends were doing by following a blog. The @ORGANIZATION1 keeps people in the know. The @ORGANIZATION1 is a great place to connect. You can see @CAPS1 your friends or family are doing with blogs, social networking sites, and more. You can meet new friends on forums, too. You don't have to call and hope your friend is at home. You can e-mail them all that you want to say. When my mom joined @CAPS3, she found her old highschool friends. They planned a reunion, and now they meet up all the time. With computers, we can keep up with old friends and meet new ones, too! Computers have changed our lives for the better. With them, we can get almost any information, know what's happening around the world, and stay in touch with family and friends. Don't you think they've made life a lot easier?",8
58,"Computers are a relitity new invention, a some-what complicated one with plus-rides and down-rides.. Some don't like the @CAPS2 because they think it's causing people to become lazy. But at this point, @CAPS2 aren't the only thing that causing their, theres, this, video games, cell phones and I-pods. @PERCENT1 of students in grade @NUM1 admit that they have one or more of the items listed above. Computers can bread, get and bunch of other things @CAPS1 of course, someone has to fies it, and the builder can't fie everything. There are jobs for living computers and all of @CAPS2 - related things. With jobs bing on low battery, use need extra job. With computers, you can look up pretty much anything, @CAPS1 if you need help with your job, homework or even just looking up a phone number, you can use the @CAPS2 for. @CAPS1, as i've said computers are a great",6
59,"Dear @LOCATION1, I am writing to you because I think computers are very helpful. They make it easier by providing more history, it has a lot more information than books do and when you need to get in touch with someone, its easier. With all these great ideas, you will see the perspective that I do. First, having computers helps when your researching history. About @PERCENT1 of the school say that when they are looking for history, there is more information on the computers. When we ask a teacher about history, they only know what they were taught. But on the computer, there are people all over the world that tell us what they learned. So, we get more information about history than what our teachers know. Secondly, computers are very helpful because they have more information than books do. I recall a time when I was doing a report on slavery, and when I was looking at information in a book, but there wasnt enough. So, I went on the internet and searched slavery and it gave me way more information then I needed. Computers are faster that flipping through the pages of a book. It would take two minutes to search it online, but if you had to look through a book, it could take hours. Being able to search for information online, would help get my work and your's done faster, by providing more information. Lastly, computers are very helpful because its easier to communicate with people. What if you didnt have a cellphone, how would you get in touch with a family member? You would go online and send them a email or talk to them on a chat. Having to get into touch with a friend or family member is very important to me, and @CAPS1 pretty sure you too. Computers make it easier to communicate with friends and family members. In conclusion, me and a lot of other people have a strong opinion about computers. They help us in many ways such as helping with researching history, has more information than books and makes it easier to communicate with people. Without a computer, life would be so complicated. I hope after you reading this, helps you to see how helpful they really are.",8
60,"Dear @PERSON1 of the @CAPS1, I would like to say the computers do not benefit the society. Computers do not help people in the world today because computer take part in obesity. Kid dont want to time with family and @CAPS5 don’t work to do homework. First, computers now a days a big hit on obesity. I on the shows @CAPS5 exercize. @CAPS5 dont want to go out and exercize because they would rather be on instant messaging there friends. Who wants to go outside in the cold @CAPS2 you can have and go on the internet or I send that almost @PERCENT1 of the @LOCATION1 citizens health has gone because of computer @CAPS2 children or @CAPS3 have computer they don't eat or sleep night. If they are on the computer people to eat and People also @CAPS4, computers take away tiime. Computers live families. Seeing that the children computer movies I tell her no I can always watch it on youtube. Finally, @CAPS5 are dropping and they arent @CAPS5 ont do their homework because they are busy on the computer @CAPS2 they come home they have to change there myspace of facebook @CAPS5 now a days have to talk to friends online then do homework. @CAPS2 I come home I go straight to the computer. I pick the computer instead of homework, because computers are easy to do. Homework is the most hardest and thing ever. Yesterday my eacher told me that I was failing then I was going on the and I yes so I might not graduate becaue of the computer. Well head of the @CAPS1 I hope that you take my opinion into consideration. Please remember this can be a good help @CAPS2 your @CAPS5 grow up.",7
61,"I think that computers have the good effects on people. With a computer, you can have social interactions with people far away, if not even a friendship. Through the internet you can find people intrested in the same kind of things that you are. You can learn about different cultures and tell about yours. For example @PERSON1 likes to play guitar, but where he lives, there's no other people intrested in the same thing. From the internet he can a large guitar community, where he can share advices and tips with other people. He has also plenty of new friends, that he found from the netsite. Also what @PERSON1 hasn't noticed is, that his typing has gotten better. Typing is a very important in your life, if you are thinking business education or you dream about being, for example, a @CAPS1. You get better in controlling your extremeties like, for example, @PERSON1's playing has gotten better. Computer is a good way to learm new things and search an information. When I had health in my school, the theacher was suprised. ""@CAPS2 do you know so many things"", she asked, I haven't thought about the answer before. So @CAPS2 did I know all these things? From the internet of course, I realized. When you surf in the internet or you search something else, you bump in to another information. Also from internet site communities you learn from other people's experiences. When you use computer you have there many useful programs like for ex the @ORGANIZATION1. My friend, for example, loves to write and is dreaming about the job of a @CAPS1 or an author. She writes a lot on her leisure time but she doesn't have to buy a writing machine besides in addition to paper, ink and dictionary. This develops her writing skills and ability to write as she loves to do. So using computers helps people learn and it develops their social skills and emotional health. It stimulate you to do what you love (like playing guitar for example) And that's why I support using computers and believe that computers have good effects on people. ",9
62,"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are a neccesity to this world. Without computers people wouldn't be able to catch up on news or maybe sports games they missed. Computers are also needed to interact with friends or family that you haven't seen for a while. The last reason why computers are needed is because they help with hand eye corrodination. These days news is a major priority to everyone. Without computers people wouldn't know that @LOCATION1 just got hit by a major earthquake and more than @MONEY1@NUM1 people died. Computers help with keeping people updated. With donations from the computer people have already donated @MONEY1 to @LOCATION1. A few days ago @ORGANIZATION2 killed one of this trainers and there is a major conterversy on whether or not he meant it or it was an accident. I knew all that information from ore website on a computer. Without these machines nobody will know what is going on daily in the world. Computers also include many features like facebook, @CAPS1, e-mail, myspace and more. All of these things help you stay connected with friends and family. So, maybe if you forgot who's house you're celebrating the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 at you can just go to your computer and check! Every once a while you feel like you're missing something for an event, well the great thing is that you can go on your computer and ask a friend. The last reason why computers aren't a bad thing is they help with hand eye corrdination. Whenever you're @CAPS4 up a paper you try not to look days at yourself @CAPS4 so then you can follow along with yourself: This really helps with hand eye corrdination. The @ORGANIZATION1 said, ""@CAPS4 a paper helps with you're hand eye corridination @PERCENT1 more than throwing a football."" You can also play games on a computer which also helps with hand eye corridination. In conclusion, having computers helps this world more than it hurst it. You can look up news, you can connect with family and friends, and they help with handeye corrdination computers are a major priority to have in this world.",9
63,"Dear Local Newspaper, Some people @MONTH1 be concerned with all of the time being spent on the computer, but I think they have a good effect on us. People can do @CAPS7 things on the computer like research @CAPS1 projects, and get to learn new things, you can interact with people from all over the world, and some people that have sickness causing them not to speak have certain programs on computers to help communicate with others. So, don't you think computers are a good advance on technology? First, people can research projects, and get to learn @CAPS7 things, @CAPS1 example, if you get a history project and have to research a president, you can just type in the name and tons of information will pop up. Morgan from @NUM1 grade says, ""I do all my school projects on the internet. It is a very good source and sometimes I look things up just @CAPS1 fun, and learn something new everyda."" @CAPS2, computers might not have the answer to a question you need @CAPS1 a project, but statistics say it will have about @PERCENT1 of the other information you @MONTH1 need. Isn't it great that we have computers? Second, you can interact with different people from all over the world. There are @CAPS7 sources you can do that through like @CAPS3, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS4, and even @ORGANIZATION2. Say you go on a vacation like a cruise, and you meet some people that you became friends with. You can stay in touch with them through the internet. @PERSON1 from @NUM2 grade says, ""I went on a cruise @DATE1, and I made @CAPS7 friends. But, there are @DATE1 girls that I still keep in touch with through @CAPS4. I talk to them usually when I get home from school."" Computers are a great thing to have so you can keep in touch with others. Lastly, people that have sickness that cause them to not speak have computers to communicate with their family. Three @DATE1 @DATE1, my neighbor had a severe stroke that kept him paralyzed, and only allows him to move his eyes up, down, and side to side. A doctor told them their is a program called @CAPS6, which has the patient line his eyes up on a certain phrase, and the computer will speak @CAPS1 him. He can also spell things out, and you can have some communication. It is a great thing to have, so the family can have a way of speaking to him. It's amazing to have advanced technology @CAPS1 these reasons, don't you think? As you can see, I think that computers have a great affect on people. Some reasons I think this are you can do research @CAPS1 projects, and learn new things, you can interact with different people from all over the world, and people that have sicknesses who can't speak have programs on the computer that helps than communicate, @CAPS7 people could disagree with me, but I think computers are great to have.",10
64,"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 the computers have an effect on those people, they should excrise nad look or explore nature, but my opinion for some people would be go on the computer for an hour or just limit the time, yes I know its fun but you still have to stay fit, smart and healthy. Being on the computer is not good for your brain. We should limit computer time for adults and kids. The effects that the kid have are possible. The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 in their brains are not as develope as adults. So yes it would be hard to get them off but show them how fun it can be off the computer. You should be getting fit moms and @CAPS4. Also take a rest and eat a healthy snack or at on that new tredmill you bought last @DATE1. Another reason why you should with the time cause who has to pay the bill cause I know that every time when the mail coms the bill come also and nobody like to pay bills. Mom and @CAPS4 I definitly think you should limit the kids computer time because there are inapropreate stuff that they might be looking at and all those websites that they are on they could be talking a chating to anybody thats very dangerous so give your kids the heads up. Show them how pretty flowers look in the @DATE2 or how bugs store food or just take the to the zoo and show the new bears hibernate. There fore the parents I know how you need to look up stuff an the computer but that great but the computer is not always right so just pop open a book once in a while its great you know so parent and was limit your time and do something like water rafting with the whol family. Have some fun and get shoe eyes off the screen and the fingers of the keyboard and go have fun.",8
65,"Dear local Newspaper, I agree with computer experts that computers poison the brain. These are some reasons why computers ""poison"" the brain: Computers can blood shot your eyes, and make your vision blurry. People are on the computer all the time they don't get a chance to exercise. The more time your on the computer, less time you spend with your family and friends. One way, that computers are bad for you because, your eyes get all blood shot when your on the computer for so long. Your vision gets all blurry and messed up, after you leave the room you bump into things and get hurt. Staying on the computer to pull off all nighter is bad for your eyes as well because when your mom, dad, brother or sister opens the blinds the sun light would blind you. Another reason why computers are bad for you because, people are on the computer all the time they don't have time to exercise. People who are on the computer @NUM1 hrs a day aren't going outside enough get fresh air, play sports, etc. instead of playing computer games. Computer games are fun once in a while, but go outside and run around for once. A final reason why computers are bad for you because your spending less time with your friends and family. Instead of @CAPS1 your friends, go talk to them in person for once. Watch a movie with your parents, hang out with your brother, go shopping with your sister. Do something instead of being on the computer all day. All in all these are the reasons that are ""poisoning"" or ""rotting"" the brain of human society.",8
66,"The question everyones asking is, should we spend less time on the computer. I think we should spend less time because excersise, talk to people in person, and learn new things, and I will explain why. When your on the computer you lose time to excersise. Without excersise you will be out of shape and wont be able to play any sports. At one point you will be skinny but if you dont do nothing and eat all day, you will become fat. Excersise helps you get your nutrition up more. You should excersise with friends so you dont have to be bored by yourself. At the end of the day when ur done then you can go one the computer. Several websites you can talk to friends. For example: @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @ORGANIZATION1 and others more. But talk to them through @CAPS3 when you can talk to them in person. When ur bored at home call a friend and hang out and play some sports. Also if you have a special somebody in your life you would want to spend time with he/she. Why meet new people online when you meet them face to face. You could get to know them better and later you could have a trust worthy friend. When you need to use the internet is when you have homework. Why just look it up on google and read a book about it. Sometimes the things on the internet is false information. In math read what you have to do instead of using the @CAPS4 and finding the answers. People cant alway rely on the computer, sometimes you just need to learn it on you own. In games people want to use cheats and it's just not fun if you dont play fairly. I strongly recommend that for now everyone who has a way to get on a computer, should spend less time and have fun with nature.",8
67,"Dear readers of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 people have been makeing a big fuss about computers. Some people think that computers are bad and we should get rid of all of them. Me I completely disagree with them. I feel computers are a new and amazing technology. They help out so much in dayly life. For example say you ar doing a report for work you can go online and use resources to find more information about the topic of the report. Say you also have bad handwriting what will you do? You would go to a computer an type your report. I agree with some people that some people spend too much time on the computer. But there are more positive things about the computer than they are negitive, for example a positive is going on google and looking up information and learning newthings. A negitive would be people spending too much time on computers. All that im trying to say is that computers are wonderful things and that it is such a privlige to have computers. I think its great we have computers in our world.",7
68,"My opinion for computers are that I do support the computers. Here are the reasons why, they are eduational for us kids. They are faster than books and they have a lot more information. And the last reason is because it has more opportunities for a lot more things. Let me explain more. The reason why I say that it is more educational is because of these reasons, they have very good websites for us to learn more, like funschool.com. That website helps you with every subject that you need help on. Another reason why I say it is education is because it helps you do essays or reports and if you need more information on what to do you can go on different websites and get exacly what you need. Like one day we had a @CAPS1.@CAPS1 project on @LOCATION1. Nobady new what @LOCATION1 was like. So kids went on diffrent websites and fond a lot of information for the project. The secon reason was faster, and the reason why I say that is because you can communicate with other people in different places faster. For example my cousin @CAPS2 is living in spane. And he also does not have a cellphone or a house phone. So when he can he goes on his yahoo and if my mom and I are on we able to talk to him. Another reason is because you are able search more things. Like if you have missed a talent show of yor family you are able to see it on the internet. The last reason was because",7
69,"Dear newspaper editor, Computers are used all around the world daily. The computer is the main thing in our society. One reason why I think so is that computers have a lot of knowledge. One other reason is you can chat with family and friends. My last reason is they help people learn. In these paragraphs, you will see why I think so. My first reason is computers have a lot of knowledge. On computers, you can search any question and get your answer. For example, say you put, ""@CAPS1 to make muffins,"" the computer will say @CAPS1 to make them. They know almost every answer. That is my first reason why computers are the main thing in society. My second reason why computers is the main thing in society is you can chat with family and friends. My one can chat on a computer. I chat with all my friends on the computer. It is really easy to do. That is my second reason why computers are the main thing in society. My last reason why computers are the main thing in society is they help people learn. People are able to go to school on computer. Have a college degree on computers. Even people work on computers that is my last reason why computers are the main thing in the society. Now you can see @CAPS1 computers are the main thing in society. Hope you agree.",7
70,"Dear Local Newspaper, @LOCATION1- @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1. I am an @NUM1 grade student at @ORGANIZATION1. I think that @CAPS5 should have computers because people can learn a lot of far away things. People have a lot of fun times playing games writting and even chatting online. Everyone loves to have computers, so lets not take it away. IPI - @CAPS2 far away new things is really great of people something it us books, why not check the internet. Internet is faster way to search things. They should have time to be in the computer, doing there homework and having a lot of fun. Computers are expensive and not easy to get, but its sure easy to search for things looking for. Computers effect people a lot but its okay let us have free time. @NUM2 @CAPS3, chatting online over the internet that sounds cool. That effects people a lot because that is taking away time to do and taking bad chances when online. I don't want to have computers it keep going with that. For during homework its all right because you can type and of writing it in a piece of paper that would take forever. Computers but it sometimes. It affects people inn some ways. @NUM3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 take away computer people think that people hate that and would not be on work. They will be with out people don't want to be searching threw books all the time, it gets trying. Please don't late affects us a alot. Conclusion - @CAPS5 do believe that computers affect other. Please local newspaper @CAPS5 are telling you the truth.",9
71,"Dear local newspaper, I agreed that computers have a positive effect on people. In this paragraph your going to learn about @CAPS1 computers are a positive effect, @CAPS1 does @CAPS5 help people, and @CAPS5 even allows people to talk online with other people. Do you want to know @CAPS1 computers are a positive effect? First, @CAPS2 way computers are a positive effects is @CAPS5 gives you more knowledge. For example, stuff you didn't know before you know now because you looked @CAPS5 up on the @ORGANIZATION1. @CAPS3 way computers are a positive effect is you can keep in touch with your family @CAPS6 your on a vacation or at a job. On the other hand many people without computers cant keep in touch with their family then, @CAPS3 way computers are a positive effect is because @CAPS5 helps many people with their jobs. For example, cops use computers to look at peoples files and their past criminal record. Last, @ORGANIZATION1's help you learn different type of launguages. Have you ever thought about @CAPS1 computers help people? First, @CAPS2 way @CAPS5 helps people is @CAPS5 organizes stuff for them. For example, none of your work will get lost and you know where you saved @CAPS5. Second, @CAPS5 also helps learn about new places and history. For example, @CAPS6 your trying to learn about china's history you can do that un the @ORGANIZATION1. Next, @CAPS3 wat @CAPS5 helps people is @CAPS5 has the ability to order stuff online from far away places. Finally, computers also help people by introducing new and fun things to them. For example, their is many games online that make the @ORGANIZATION1 also fun and not boring. Many people agree that talking online over the @ORGANIZATION1 is fun. First, @CAPS2 way @CAPS5's fun is because you meet new people you havent known before. Second, @CAPS3 way talking online with other people is fun because you get to learn more stuff about that person and his/her cultur. Next, @CAPS6 also gives a chance for the people that dont have friends make some over the internet. Last, @CAPS5 also helps you talk to your family that lives in @LOCATION1 or even further. Have you ever thought of a @ORGANIZATION1 having positive effects? @CAPS6 you did, why dont you mension some stuff in your essay like I did for example, @CAPS1 computers are positive effects, @CAPS1 @CAPS5 helps people, and @CAPS5 even allows people to talk online with other people.",10
72,"Dear people of @CAPS1, Have you ever thought about how many people in @CAPS2 are fat or obaes? Of how many hours they spend playing on the computer instead of exerciseing? What some people don't mind this lifestyle of no exercis, not seeing nature, and no friends or family to keep company with, I do not agree with this lifestyle. Imagin a hom of a bird, the dew on the grass, or the sound of the trees getting blown. Don't you just love the relaxing sounds and sights of nature? People who play on the computer say: this is the only world I kneed, and don't take the time to smell the roses. I took a survay and @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people said they would rather stay in and play video games instead of watch the clouds or do something outside. Now imagin this you have not seen light in over a week, what happens when you need to go out... you'll get blinded by the sun. Also not only is nature a great place to relax but @CAPS4 you don't go out in the sun a lot it could have servire conquense on your body, like your skin turns pale, your imune situm weakends, and you gain weight fast. Now think about this do you want your kids or do you want to look like some fat, pale person who is sick all the time? Imagin this you sit at the computer all day and all you eat is fast food, and you get up to walk around or do any kind of exercise. Does that sound fun to you? Some people who play on the computer waste almost @PERCENT1 of there day playing a game on the computer. I asked a person who usto send that kind of time on the computer he said |""I to spend so much time on the computer I forgot all about what my body needed. When i tried to get up one day and could not, that's when it hit. I need to do more for my body, I needed to take better care of it."" @CAPS3 now gotton back to his feet and fells way netter than he ever has. he thinks that spending almost @PERCENT1 of your day on the computer is a waste of time for all who do it or are thinking of doing it. Imagin you stuck in a box with no friends only a computer as your company. What would you do? Most gamers do this and end up lossing very dear friends or family members to this. I asked ex-gamer @PERSON1 about this, all @PERSON1 said was ""I think that it wastes perious time with your family. I almost missed my daughter frist steps because of this adtion. I also almost lost all of my best friends."" @CAPS4 you enjoy the smell and sight of nature, you care about your body, and you dont want to lose perious family time or friends. Then I sugest you vote yes to putting a band on compers.",9
73,"Dear @PERSON1, I think that the advancing of computers and technology are a good thing. I think so because computers teach good hand-eye coordination, are a good source for research and lets you comunicate with people no matter how far away. So lets a take a good look at how computers give us a hand. I think computers are very helpful in life. I think this because they teach good hand-eye coordination.""@CAPS1 who have hand-eye coordination have a better chance at doing well in sports which is a great way to stay fit,"" says @PERSON3 of @CAPS2 view @CAPS3. High. I agree with @ORGANIZATION1's statement because how would you be able to play baseball without hand-eye coordination. For example, my friend chose uses the computer alot and is the star of the basball team.This is because you need good hand-eye coordination to be able to swing the bat while your watching the hall come at you. next i would like to help you learn about why the computer is so helpful. Say you one doing a project and you need some information you just can't find in the books. Where do you turn? The computer. ""@CAPS4 it comes to research the internet is the way to go"" says @PERSON2 of @ORGANIZATION2,"" @CAPS5 whore my most successful graduates found most of their research. More than @PERCENT1 of students use internet research daily. Would you want you children to be well educated with updated technology? Now I would like to talk to you about why I think the computer is important. My final reason I think computers are very useful is because it is a great way to comunicate with computers it is a easy to talk to people all over the world with no charge. For example @CAPS4 my mom wants to talk to my grand parents in @LOCATION1 she just uses the computer instead of running up the phone bill @PERCENT2 of americans use the ineternet as a form of communication. SO finally I think that the advancing of computers would be good since we rely on them so much. Since they are so important to improve hand-eye coordination, help with research, and comunicate would you want then outdated?",9
74,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I absolutly agree that people are spending way to much time on the computer, and spending less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family of friends. It just would be better for everyone to get out of the house, instead of sitting in front of the computer all day. People need to enjoy life. If everyone was just sitting in front of the computer all day, they will never enjoy life around us. People need to just walk outside and see nature. If they can't do that, they could exercise. Whenever I need to calm down, or even when I get mad at my parents, I go upstairs to my room and do some yoga. It relaxes me, we all should do this, too. A perfect example is when I was watching @PERSON1. I didn't want to put my mom made me. There was this women and she was so adicted to the computer. She has a part time job and barely feeds her kids. She would give her kids microwave meals for dinner, because she was on the computer every second of the day. When she was done with her job, she would go on facebook till one in the @TIME1. Then she would go to bed then set her alarm, so she can go on the computer again at @TIME1. So she barely feeds her kids, wakes up early every @TIME1 just to go on the computer. So once people get adicted with the computer, you can barely do anything about it. We need to enjoy life. Nature, friends, family. All part of life. Enjoy it while we can. About @NUM1 people probably don't go on the computer. Some effects we have on the computer for some people is they can get addicted, the computers there only friend, or even not liking outdoors. But the computer is not your only friend. You can have plenty more friends. If you go on facebook, and you have @NUM2 friends, you have someone to talk to. Don't just sit there in front of the screen and @CAPS3 them or email them. You should have a face to face conversation with that person. Your actually out, instead of in your house all day. It would be nice just to get some fresh air @NUM3 people, out of @NUM4, enjoy going outdoors. For example, my best friend asked me if I can go to the movies and then sleep over her house. But I said no because I was to busy playing on my computer. She was upset. And so was I. I didn't realize what I said to her. But I called her back up and apoligized. No one should be to busy to play the computer, instead of hanging out with friends. We all need to enjoy life, and hang out with friends and family. We allowed to enjoy life while we can.",10
75,"Imagine you are on the computer at work but then all of the sudden your computer screen goes blank it has crashed, and you've lost all of the information that is vital for your to know and remember. A computer breaking could happen to anyone but the large problem is, most people don't know how to fix it. All of your information is gone and you are stuck without a way access all of the data you need for work, or you can't find important news online. This could happen with your children's computers too and they could loose necessary assignments for school. Computers are needed by everyone, and they have so many positive affects on people we can not afford to loose them. Most of us don't think about it that often but we store so much of our lives on the on a computer, if your computer broke, you would be loosing, more than just the internet, you would be loosing photographs you wanted, important word documents, or you loose information on important events you have learned, you don't wont to forget someone's birthday now you? My sisters computer broke two weeks ago and she lost a she had to turn in for colledge. She had to find the paper she wrote, and she needed to retype the entire paper on some else's computers do you wont all of that added simply because your computer brake? Not everyone lives are and we all need computers, it is much easier looking up the important news on the computer on @CAPS1.com rather than finding the news on @CAPS2. Everyone needs to know the news because it is important to be aware of the world around you. Especially if it's about your and the and the news affects you. Computers help us find the news we need to know quicker and easier. At @PERCENT1 of the people in my family have their own computer. It is necessary for us kids to have them too. These been many times where I've been sick and all I had to do was go on the schools website and find the assignments I missed. So I can be prepared for school the next day. Three out of five of my teachersuse computers in the classroom to teach the students in various ways that are more fun than just reading from a text book. The other teachers that don't have us using computers on a regular basis have used them though and that shows just how uuseful computers can be. Everyone uses computers. Everyone needs computers they are too important to loose and up have come to depend on them for work, awareness of the world around us and school. A life with no computers would be like.",9
76,"Local Newspaper, @CAPS1. you! The one reading this paper! I think that it's okay that people spend so much time on the computer. I am one those people who spend @NUM1 hours a day on the computer. I have @NUM2 reason for this type of amount. My first reason is communication. My second reason is educational benefits. And my last and third reason is the occupation. I hope you will pay close attention these three reasons. You never know who can change your mind. Like I said before, my first reason for thinking daily computer use is okay is because of the communication. It is stated that @PERCENT1 of chiildren, and/or teenagers, have installed a computer communication system. The very popular sites, are such as, @CAPS2, @ORGANIZATION1!. MSN, @CAPS3 or @CAPS4. These are the easiest ways of computer communication. My second reason I think using a computer on a daily basis is the learning They make computer games from ages @NUM2-7. These games are @PERCENT2 educational. Game include childrens favorite as @CAPS5 and @CAPS6. These games of ten in subjects of math, science, history, typing games, and sometimes different languages. My third reason for thinking staying on a computer for a daily basis is okay is because of the occupation. Computers keep me occupied all day on video games, music, and videos. It is said that playing computer games keeps your brain well stimulated. Are you still there? Once again my @NUM2 reasons for thinking being on the computer for a daily basis is, the communication secondly, educational privlages. Third reason, the occupatied is a big one. Well, I have to go now, please take these reason under consideration.",8
77,"Dear @LOCATION2 newspaper, @CAPS1, my name is @LOCATION1 and I think computers very much benifet are life and that lots' of positive things can com from them. We can learn and get smarter, we can @CAPS3 act with new people and it is just a really great life still lots of good can come from computers. First, one reason computers can be a healthy thing is we can learn and get smarter from them. One the @CAPS2 there is all different sites that have information for anything that your mind can think of. This could help if you need to research for a project or just want to know a fact. Sure you could say that any one could put anything on the @CAPS2 but what are the chances of all the information and facts to be wrong? I think vary slim. Another way we could learn and get smarter is from all the @CAPS3 active games that many children play. You could play a math game, a reading game any game you want and all of these @MONTH1 make you smarter. I think there are many ways to learn from computers and grow. Second, another way computers can be a life learning thing is you @NUM1 to interact with all different people. You could meet anyone you would like. If you wanted to meet with your friends or family to catch up you could or if you just want to talk you could to you could even see them through the computer. This would reconnect you to old friends or to help up with your family. You could also meet people from other countrys. This would show you how other people live or how or what there culture is like. I think I would be very interesting to see new people and sights. last you could even just find a friend to talk to and you would be a much more stranger person because you have more friends and you would learn more. Last, computers just give everyone more life skills. One you get to learn how to type. Which could improve your hand eye coordination. Also this will help everyone in school type and write papers for a class. Another skill this will give you is you will learn how to research and find information. This will deffenetly be a life still because you always going to need to know how to gather information. Also, if you didnt know how to do this you wouldnt be able to find out where to go for car routes or what restaurants are good or anything. I think mostly computers are a great invention and addition to our life. In conclusion, computers are great. From the rest of our lives technology will keep changing and never stop so sooner or later we will have to learn somethings about computer. Computers are a big help in my life, are they in yours?",9
78,"Dear Local Newspaper, I disagree and agree in the same time. If you want to know why read on. I disagree because in the winter some people don't like to go any where because of the snow. What are going to do? of course they are going to be in their computer like know and days it snow's and yes some but are going. All so people like talking family because know we have webcams and its fun seeing your face and especially your family for example I talk to my family in webcam because they live @LOCATION1 and I live in @ORGANIZATION1. I know some people would like to see there family. Where other people some time people don't go outside and what are you. You nothing but sitting there. Then I agree. I agree because I know we should go outside and play because it is good for us. Also I think when we are in the computer it gets boring. We should also be with are family then bring in the computer. go out with are family and go places because we are not going to do any thing better than in the computer. Go out and eat with family. Theardly I think if thres people would rather be in the computer than be with there family and going outside its there dision. They will miss out of the fun with every body they love. Thank you for reading what I had to say. I hope you like it. I also hope think you should think about what I wrotes...",8
79,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 in a few years everyone in the @LOCATION1 is over weight. That would be horrible. All people do now days is stay on there computer. All you do is sit there looking at a screen. To me computers are just a waste of time. It’s not a real thing, it makes you have less exercise, and it boring. So, you decide if you want everyone to over weight, but I will not be because I don’t sit at my computer all day. “@CAPS5 wheres dad?” “@CAPS6’s on the computer” “@CAPS7 computers,” I’ve asked my @CAPS5 this a lot and dads always there. @CAPS6 says to me look what @CAPS8 @CAPS9 just sent me. I don’t use at all. Its not the real thing. Computers to me are just a waste of time. When you talk to your friends on facebook, isn’t the same as reality. It is better to talk face to face with your friends and family, @CAPS10 thing is lets say your talking to your best friend. When your together you can say whatever you want. Like my friend @PERSON1 we tell each other anything. But, facebook or @CAPS11 you cant say some staff. One more reason is your talking to a girl you like, but you can’t say you love her on the computer. that is just. Therefore we shouldn’t use them like this. “@CAPS12” I always here my name for something because my parents sit on the computer a lot for work and they are so lazy they cant walk downstairs for something. No, they ask me. You see computer make people have less exercise. When people email each other I hate it, why can’t you walk outside to your mail box and send a letter. People don’t move, walk, or do anything they have less exercise. Even if they were on the computer for @NUM1 hours a day they would have in activities, and exercise. Finally, my last reason. Computers are boring. It’s not as interactive as going outside playing with your friends and family. Yeah you talk to people, but it’s in little words on computers. Outside in real world people talk and laugh together because there friends are doing funny things. How is that funny reading that off a computer. It’s not/ @CAPS13 with friends and family socializing is better besides all you’re doing is stareing at a screen. I bet you can go blind if all you do is sit there all day stareing at a screen with your eyes popping out. There is nothing you can do except sit there while you friends are outside playing because your to fat to have fun exercise so you stay on your computer. @CAPS4 kids and families are outside socializing having fun no where near a computer. This is awesome. Nothing is as real as this. Computers are not realy makes you have less exercise, and are boring. So, is it better to sit there bored to death or going out side, execising, having fun with you friends? I say having fin with friends.",9
80,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1 and I was writing to state @CAPS1 opinion about the effects of computers. I think that computers are great and they should only be used when you have to look information upon the internet. Some people are spending to much time on the computer and that is how some people get in trouble, should be doing more things with your family instead of just playing on the computers. I also think that maybe the computers are good for some games but not all of them some are a and some are just plane . One thing you should never do id sing up on things you don't know becuase you can easily get wound in a place that you don't want to be in and that is in some one hime the know and will get you i'll really . I think that more parents should . I have wanted . And I did things . So I only went on the sites that I had to see I would picked up and be able to see big family again . @CAPS1 mom always said to . water, I didn't want that. there was a that had been around some guy on the internet. One day she up missing her parents where she went they had no the girl was she came back her parents didn't think it was her so they abanded her she fallowed them then they finally got convinced it was her now she is happely with her faimly. I hope that I convinced you that alot of people get into trouble and don't know how to get out and they wind up in a ban situation.",7
81,"Don't you think that computers help people more than make things ? Computers do help people because they take you to the websites you want to see easily, they make duplicating papers easily, and they make talking much easier. More and more people are starting to use computers the right way by doing their work or research and doing it very quickly. First, computers help you by taking you to all the websites you want to see fast and easily. Whether you want to see how your fantasy baseball team is doing or to your teacher's homework page to see what you have to do that night. When it is in the morning and its cold do you want to go out and get your new paper or would you rather walk from your bedroom to the computer? I'd rather take a couple stops to my computer because they are also very convenient @CAPS1 that @ORGANIZATION1 has come out with the I-phone you basically have a computer in your pocket. The only thing is you can't type a school paper and print it out, which brings me to my second reason. My second reason why I think that having computer is a good thing is because you don't have to write a paper twice or even three times to make copys. Instead make them the easy way by just typing them on your computer. Then just press print and it will have a little box that you how many copys you an you can just put the number of copys whether its two or three, or if you are a teacher and have @NUM1 studens you can print @NUM1. My @NUM3 reason why I think that computers make life easier is because they help you talk to people without having to pick up the phone and having to call them. @CAPS1 there are @CAPS2 messaging which you can have a conversation with someone as if you were face to face talking because it is really fast and they also have e-mail where you can share information about business to other business across town, acrossthe country or even acrossthe world in as fast as a single click of send You can also talk to people on social websites like facebook when you and your friends can be in the same chat group taking back and forth. So why, would you waste your time writing a letter to someone and a week later response or picking up the phone and calling a single person at a time when you can just go on your computer. Are you still wondering whether computer make life easier for people? They do make life easier by showing you what websites you want to see fast and easy, they help making copys of papers faster by selecting the number of copys you want. Instead of rewriting them, and they make chatting with friend faster than writing letters. So the next time you type a paper would you rather be on a typewriter looking through history books or typing on a computer, pulling up information and talking with friend at the same time?",10
82,"To whom this @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1 has been much controversy over the debate of computers and how helpful they truly are to our society. I would like to share my educated opinion on this subject, I believe computers are a great asset to society for several reasons. The first being that it is the most popular way to get your news via the internet. Secondly, they allow for automation of various things such as machinery to allow less people to have to work on site. And finally, they are very powerful education tools when connected to the internet. Computers are incredibly useful on a worldwide level for news. A study done shows that @PERCENT1 of people get their news from the internet. Infact, of these @PERCENT1, @PERCENT2 of them receive the news from social networking sites such as digg, twitter, and facebook, for example, within @NUM1 minutes of it occuring twit-pics were posted on twitter of the devastating 8.@NUM1 magnitude earthquake that occured in chile. Another great asset computers have on our society is the ability of automation, both physically and on computers themselfs. Physical automation of machinery at a factory means their are less people needed to work on the job site, while still being able to produce an amount equal to or more of goods a normal staff would be able to produce. It could mean less liability's due to a lower staff number, and companys would make more money and be able to continue to innovate and improve their products. This then causes competition and will make other companys feel they should do the same. This will make companies keep innovating to beat the others and could help stimulate the economy. Finally, with a simple computer at your home, you can very easily become rich with knowledge, for if you know what your doing and where to look, it is as if you had an endless encyclopedia which which is constantly updated with more information. They are a great asset to schools and to students as if needed you can access nearly all of your textbooks online. In fact deans of colleges can even agree with and back up this statement. So this was my informed statement on how useful computers truly all, with ease of acces to news...",9
83,"Computers are one of the most used technology today. Computers give us great benefits to our world and society. Computers give us the opportunity to learn new things. Also, they provide us with communciation among friends and family. Futhermore, computer are an exellent way to explore our world. Don't you sometimes wonder what's out there? I know I do. Computers are great for exploring our world that we never knew was there, looking up information, images and or even people. Our world is enormous and not everyone has the opportunity to travel to different countries and places and meet new people so, computers is that one way ticket. Not everyone keeps intouch with family and friends forever. Computers provide communication with loved ones. For example, last @DATE1 my mother on facebook found one of her friends from @LOCATION1. They started to chat and the next thing you know her friend she hasn't seen in @NUM1 years came from @LOCATION2 to vist her. Also, a lot of people move thousands of miles away from their famly. My family and I moved from @LOCATION1 and only sometimes our family comes to visit if they can. We stay in touch with our family through computers. My sister and I go on webcam and talk to our cousin, @CAPS1 all the time. It's really great to have a way to see our family. People all over the world find ways to communicate with each others and a big percentage of those people us computers. Computers are a great way to get up to date with what's going on around us. My mother's boss doesn't have a television so the only way he sees the news is by computer. Others such as I have so many questions about our world or anything at that matter. One of the biggest ways to get my answer is computers. They have the answer to everything. No one knows everything about everything but the computer does! Forty-three out of fifty people say that the easiest and most reliable way to get information or research is the computer. To conclude, many people depend on computers. They have very good benefits to our society today. Such as, providing communication with friends and family. Also, by letting us explore our world in a whole new way and giving us the opportunity to learn new things everyday.",9
84,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 I have an artcle for you! Computers, just about everyone uses them. What most people don’t know is that they are acually helping them. Computers help people in many ways, they help with hand-eye coordination, they help with information, and even social lives. First computers help with hand-eye coordination. The obvious is the mouse, you need to be able to move the mouse where you want inorder to use a computer. I know I like playing games on the computer. In order to play games you need to not only move the mouse but are the boy board while looking at the screen. Next is computers help with information. Whenever you need to final something out you can go on serch engines like @ORGANIZATION1 or @LOCATION1. It links the whole world so someone knows what your searching for. You can see far away places on computers. You can use programs like @ORGANIZATION1 earth and venture all over the world. Lastly computers are good for a social life. I know just about everyone I know uses either my space or @CAPS3. It's easier to alk to and conect with friends and family online. Say you have family in @LOCATION2. To talk to them or see them you would have to drive to @LOCATION2. Now with computers it's just a click away! You can instant @CAPS4 people, and it's just like talking on the phone but a lot asles! Sure some people spend too much time on their computer but it's fine in moderation. Computers are the new way to socialize, get info, and work an skills like hand-eye coordination.",8
85,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I am writting this letter to you to inform you on the importance of computers. Computers help with connecting with friends on websites such as @CAPS4 and @CAPS5. Those two are really popular. These websites helps connect you to your long lost friends. Also computers help with studying @CAPS6 stuff in the world. Also the biggest one is @CAPS7 witch helps you get online text books and strings. These reasonings are vital to people. Todays Technology has adopted since the @NUM1 th century. What a lot of people like me are into these days are social networking sites. @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 are two of the biggest. What a big problem is with them are that they are so addicting to young adults and kids. But in reality @CAPS11 not as bad as people. Think they are. They allow you to connect with Friends and also they can help connect you to long lost Friends.They really are good. Whats truly great about computers is how you can go on a ""virtual vacation"" @CAPS9 you want to find world news, @CAPS10! its right at your finger tips. @CAPS9 you wouldd like to look at indian tribes, @CAPS11 you go, you get @NUM2, @NUM3 links. Working with a computer is one of the greatest inventions ever. A truly good thing about the computer is how it can help you with @CAPS7. For our science class we have to use online text books. With that being said we have to log on to @CAPS12.hrw.com. Microsoft has really come up with some real good ideas such as word or outlook. All of them help achieve one thing @CAPS7. They are truly one of the best things computers have. These reason should open your eyes to how important a computer is to an average kid. These three reasons are just a few of the millions of reasons on how important a computer is. So please, read this over care fully and take this in to consideration. Thank you!",8
86,"Dear, editor of local newspaper, I think that computers are a good thing for our society. They can allow you to talk online to diffent people. The computer also increases your hand eye cooridination. Also the computer lets you meet faraway people and learn about faraway places. I think that talking online makes the computer a benefit to our society because we could get help for homework or if not if there was any. You could also talk to your friend if the go to a different school or. Another reason why computers are good because you can talk to a relative that you havent seen in while. If you do not have reletives like you could talk to your brother, sister, mom, or dad. Also the internet is a great way to meet new people or learn more about the people you already know. You can meet new people like people your friends know or your friends cousins as friends but its an up to who you want to talk to online. Computers are good for improving hand eye coordination. That can make yo type faster to finish home work or a project. Also the better your hand eye coordination the better you can be in some sports. So people type for fun but what they dont know is their actually improving their hand eye coordination. Some job employers require that you only type never hand write things so if you have good hand eye coordination you could type neatly fast. Therefore the computer improves your hand eye coordination depending on how much you type. The computer can also teach about far away places and by talking to the people that live in their places can you information on their places. You could learn things like why the i usually like or if it has any nice scenery in that country/place.",8
87,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people at some point of their life has used a computer, @CAPS3 it was to find specific information or talk to a friend. In @CAPS2 ways, computers benefit so much in our lifes, from giving us news from around the @CAPS7 to watching videos for entertainment. But some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on computers and less time exercising and enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. I disagree with the experts because I believe that computers unite the @CAPS7, provides unlimited amounts of information, and can help start a person's carrer. One reason I think computers are beneficial to society is because they can unite the @CAPS7. Ever since the computer was made they have been making new ways to interact with other people, no matter how far away they are. Social websites like @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 allows people to talk with all sorts of people. For instance, if you have a family member living in @LOCATION1, if your family member and you have @CAPS4 accounts you could friend request her and be able to talk whenever you want. Wouldn't you love to be able to talk with far away relatives? I know I would! Another reason why I think computers are beneficial to society is the unlimited amount of information computers have with computers, you can know just about anything you desire. You can find a recipe for chocolate cake, you can find the total amount of men who served in @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS10, seeing nature in person is better than looking it up on your computer, but what you find on the computer not only improves your knowledge on nature, but also can increase your love for it! Finally, I think that computers are beneficial to society because it can launch a person's carrer. For example, my favorite band @CAPS11 @CAPS12 started their carrer on @CAPS5. After word spread about their music labels were drying to sign them. So just by using a computer to post their music on the internet they've become incredibly famous. It's now or never, you can either benefit from what computers can provide you or just always be a step behind. Most importantly, with all the knowledge you have gained from computers you can go on to be a very successful buisnessman or musician. Smart, determined people would take advantage of what computers have to offer. So, if you are smart and determined continue to use your computers and have a great life!",10
88,"Dear local news paper, I am writing about your question about the affects of computers. I think that it does benefit society because you can learn about cultures, you can see all the places in the world, you can interact with your family and friends, and lastly it helps you with hand eye coordination. On computers you can learn about all the cultures of the world, right at your fingertips. Also if you want to know what they do or eat or do for fun you can look that up with a click of a mouse. No more going to the library and spending hours looking up different places in the enciclopedia, and not finding much. Go on the internet, look it up you are bard to find some culture, or mabe even find out about your culture. There is countless cultures to see, find a computer, and look something up! Your bound to learn something knew and exciting. With a computer you can go around the world. By on click of the mouse you can go to @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1, @LOCATION5, @LOCATION3, ect. With the internet you can travel around the world to see how differrent it is, or how much worse it is than your home country. Seeing the world will open up your mind, it will mkae you appreciate the world for what it is. Also appreciate what you have; to be thankful for your family and friends. The best part is, is that you can explore any place you want, go to australia and see the outback, go to south america and see the @LOCATION4. No danger, just the wild wilderness of the real world. No more boring pictures, go onto google earth and explore the earth, let your mind run free, no more un moving pictures, the real deal. Also watching free online vidios about nature will be even easier, but less interactive. With computers you can interact with other people online, on or in a chat room. If you or your friend moved away, you can talk with a web-cam and see each other instead of writing letters, @CAPS1, or emailing. It is like he/she is right there next to you. The stone age is over, there's technology, use it interact with old buddies, talk with them almost face-to-face. Computer chats are the way to go! While using a computer is good, using to much is bad. Kids these days should spend more time outside, away from technology. They should explore the real nature, not to nature. But that doesnt mean you shouldn't use the computer it just means don't over use it. We still need to interact with the real world. Use it but but don't abuse it! Lastly computers help with hand-eye coordination. Witch is good for all most every most every known to man. Using computers increases your hand-eye coordination. So once in a while play a computer game, just improve it so you can use it in sports. In conclusion, I think computers benefit society in a positive way. I think that evry one, one in a wile should go on a computers and explore it. Computers help you with learning about different cultures, seeing around the world and its nature, interactin with people online. But don't over use it. Computers are absolutly wonderful but nothing compare to the real world. Like famous computer inventor @PERSON1 said, ""Computers can help us in every day life, but nothing can compare with what is realy out there!""",9
89,"Dear Local Newspaper: I have recently read that computers of becoming very will now and used for many things. The survey in your article said that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 - children use the computer a day. In my opinion we should have the computer. Firstly, Computers help you with school. The way computers help in in school is they also you to look up many important things you @MONTH1 need for a project or homework. @PERSON1 a teacher at the middle school in @LOCATION1 said that @PERCENT2 of the teachers use the computer for class to give students vissuals on what they are learning. These days the computer is used more and more for schooling and such, people have online colledge corces if they can now go to school. Profsaer @PERSON2 said that @PERCENT3 of his students use the computer for school for class assignments such as textbooks that are online. That is why computers are important for school. Secondly, you can talk to people I socialize with friends. Which is good because you need to talk to family & friends that away or live in a different such day is. @PERSON2 says""@CAPS1 & teens are socializing though computer this way thatn and."" The computer protecs people from harm. How? you are probably saying well if people hear your through the phone then they you and could That is why talking through computer is not a idea at all. Thirdly, you can use the computer to learn about faraway places people. While you are on the computer you don't just play games or chat you use it for about people that are famous and very well know. I remember when I was in history in @NUM1 grade I had to write about a musition and I did and I found realy good info about @CAPS2 and him, so computers are a big part of learning & projects acts.. As you can see computer are good for learning about faraway places & people. In conclusion, computers have a very big effect on people. My reasons are schooling, socializing, and lastly learning about faraway places and people. I urge you to keep computers. I know hand this important desition to you, pleas make the right one.",8
90,"As computers and the internet become so populer, more people start to say that they are having a negative affect so society. They say that people spend more time on their computers and less time getting outside and being healthy. I strongly disagree with this. Computers help in many way. They help the environment and are a better news service. There even more ways that they can help. Computers can store a lot of information. They save this information of having to keep it on paper. With all the info it stores, there's a lot of paper you wouldn't need to use. This is why computers are for the environment. People have to cut down trees to get paper. If paper is used less, then would be cut down less. When your getting news off the computer, you're saving trees too. You're getting news off of the computer instead of the neewspaper. Newspapers are made of paper. It's in their name. Using the computer is less paper being used and that save trees. Newspapers get their information, they they have to put in a newspaper and it the next day. It's day old news. On the computer news can be set as fast as minutes it happens. News in much faster and reliable on a computer. You also don't have to wait until the newspaper comes to your to get the news. Some newspaper companies don't deliver the paper until @NUM1 at @NUM2 o'clock in the @TIME1. On the computer you can just go on the internet and click on the news. Which would only take about @NUM3 seconds. News on the computer is much @CAPS1 of the more recent luxuries of the computer is socializing. There are many ways you can talk with your friends on the internet. You can talk with your friends on @CAPS2. You could also dont on @CAPS3. The best part of it is that it's all completely @CAPS4. If use your phone, you have to pay for the minutes. Not on the computer. I hope you can see how the computer makes so many tasks easier and fast. Or how the computer is very helpful for the environment. You can socialize on it and you can find news on it. It's just the better choices.",8
91,"Dear @CAPS1 of the Local Newspaper: @CAPS2 editors you decide what stories get to be put in our newspaper. I would like you to include my article on computers. I beleive computers have good and bad affects on people. Computers are dangerous, and not very healthy. However, they are a great tool for learning. On the other hand, computers are very addicting and can take control of your life. First of all, computers can be very dangerous. Especially when it involves the internet. There are many website such @CAPS2 facebook, twitter, and myspace where you can have your own profile that strangers @MONTH1 view. Nothing on the internet is private, therefore when naughty pictures are released, you can get in big trouble. My neighbor, went to a party where there was alcohol and a lot of bad people. She had fun, but her friends took pictures and put them on facebook. She is very smart and applied for @ORGANIZATION2, a college in @LOCATION1. Unfortunatley, she did not know the board of @ORGANIZATION2 and all other colleges, check facebook for innappropriate pictures. Therefore, she was not accepted into @ORGANIZATION2, not because she wasn't smart, but because of the innappropriate drinking pictures that went on facebook. Secondly, computers are very unhealthy, because of several reasons. One reason is because they are so addicting and time flies when you are on them. @NUM1 out @NUM2 teenagers do nothing but computer/internet when they get home. Their bodies need exercise! ""@CAPS3-a-days, technology is getting more and more advanced, and all people aren't exercising enough. We are all refreshing our internet explorer page for the lastest update!"" says @PERSON1 from @ORGANIZATION1. Some parents @MONTH1 think their kids being on the computer @NUM3 is good practice for being the next ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5,"" but it's just a waste of time and unhealthy. However, even though computers @MONTH1 be unhealthy and dangerous, they are great for school work and learning. When the internet is not being used for chatting and profile-ing, it is a great way to be taught more and exciting things. ""@CAPS6"" is a great website to search the web and to use for finding biographies and research landmarks or historical moments or figures. Other websites such @CAPS2, ""ask.com"" and ""wikipedia.com"" are excellent for looking for pictures of places for a power point presentation. Not everyone has the money to travel, so why not look on the internet for a beautiful island, close your eyes, and pretend you're there?! In conclusion, computers are horrible for our bodies, dangerous for our safety, yet wonderful for school use. Please put this article in our local newspaper. That way maybe people will change their way of living, and not live like the slabs I see all of us becoming. Thank you for your time.",10
92,"Dear Newspaper editor, I have been notified about the recent argument concerning wether or not computers give ""positive"" or ""negative"" affects on people. In personally believe they give off a positive affects. My reason for believing that is based on my own life expireance and on what I have seen. I have no siblings, so I'm always alone. I get depressed from that fact, but the internet provided me with people to talk to. I can also study for the many harsh things that can come up in school. Last my father is in @LOCATION1, so that means hes not here to show me love, but with the internet I can @CAPS1 cam with him, which will make me not worry alot. All my life I have been alone, I have no siblings to keep me company. Although I have friends that are like brothers to me, that still isn't enough to fill my loneliness wen I feel lonely, I turn to the internet. It allows me to chat with people from all places. Wen im talking I feel happy and not lonely. School can be rough; the home work, test, reports. Without internet, you probably would not finish half the stuff you are suppose to finish in that ammount of time. With internet, I can study for those important test's, and finish those important assingnments. My father is in the @ORGANIZATION1 wich means hes always being deployed for an extended period of time. Wen that happens, our communication is limited. We found a solution to this and its called ""@CAPS1 caming"", thanks to the interest I can check up on my father and make sure hes ok. Also my father can do the same with me. I can see his face and let my worries leave my mind, so that I can focus on school and other equally important things. Well that is my opinion on the computer argument. It not only helps me with lonelyness, school, and communication, but much more than that. It also helps millions and millions of other people.",9
93,"It's better for people to spend more time on computers because with out them we can not make now enventions. Students also can not check there school work @CAPS1 they missed any friends also can not communicate with each other @CAPS1 they're far away. with out people spending on computers life will be harder for every one. @CAPS1 people don't spend time on computers, it will be harder to com up with new enventions. maybe car components will will come less and less advancer and withut computers cars can not run. The reason why is because a computere in a car is how you steer, or accelerate, even put the heater or A.C. on. The car wouldn't know what to do. a major reason why we need computers is the military. @CAPS1 we didn't have then in the military we wouldn't knoe ehat or how to get into a biulding. We also wouldn't know were people are because we wouldn't have access to satelite. Another reason why we need computers is to make more efficient ways to make the earth healthier so we don't polute the air with power plants. with out computers kids can not larn the right way. It would be hard for kids to amazin what the teacher is trying to say. @CAPS1 we didn't have mime boards we can't have an interactive way and fun way to learn, @CAPS1 we keep enventing new technology for school students will be able to visualize history better. Also @CAPS1 a student was abscent he couldn't go online to check or checking his website. @CAPS1 You have friends that either live in a different state you wouldn't be able to communicate with him. People coudn't talk to each other online or type to each other. @CAPS1 you have a relitive or someone closely related in college you couldn't talk to him unless you send letters, letter are usaully reall slow to get to each other, but by computers you can see each other instatly without computers the world can not function. @CAPS1 people didn't use computers the world would not turn. People can not communicate the way they want to. People can not event things, military would be falling apart. This is my opinion why poeple need to use computers.",8
94,"Dear local newspaper, I am writing this letter to you because computers are effecting people these days. Starting with myspace it's causing people to not interact with family members. Theres a lot of websites out there many of them are causing problems like I don't know alot too many. Then theres games people spend more time doing that than going to work, going to school and doing things there supposed to do. There not doing any of this because there on computers all day. I think if there wasn't access to all of this there would be more people doing what they got to do. I believe there should be less websites so peole come able to go to school and work instead of being unhealthy.",5
95,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you agree that all people spend time on the computer but only what they can handle. My reason of sayin this is because firstly learning, c ommuncate with people, projects. Firstly, On the computer you can learn alot of things that your probaly really interested in. Like say your interested in being a lawyer or say maybe getting in to real state. They really @CAPS1 teach things like that in school. Wouldn't you agree? An maybe even your family is going on a vaction and you wanna learn about the place. An diffent fun places you can go. Second, I cant see my freinds everyday or call the either. So the best simplist way is to talk to them on the computer. And if one of my family member or even freinds live really far an your unable to call. I can go on the computer an talk. Wouldn't you agree. An in my experinents I havent talk to my best freind from third grade till she moved. and I found her page on the computer and started talking again it was amazing I could I was taking her years inst amazing? Isn't it amazing how you can learn about basicaly amost anything. So if doing a project all I have to do is go on the computer looking in encyclopedia instead all i have to type in the subject/topic and all my info is right infront of me. An it can also teach me now to speak other lanuges. Som people even take college over a computer. And I can't go without comptures never did since @CAPS2 born. Learning communacition. are the reason people are on the computer so much. I hastley, think people are not spending too much time if thats why they so be it.",8
96,"One does not believe in the wonder of computers because they don't benefit society at all. Statistics have shown that @PERCENT1 of kids who go on the computer research bad sites and see thinks that kids their age should not see. It is not good for children's health to always be on the computer as soon as they got home from school. If we banish computer or at least brought the use down to a minimum we would still be able to do the same exact things without computers. One does not believe in the use of computers. Computers do not benefit society at all. When kids got on the computer they almost always research bad things their parents wouldnt want them to see. Kids go onto bad sites when they @PERCENT2 of the kids have been bullied at least twice on the internet. When you are on those ""chat rooms"" not only can you be bullied but you @MONTH1 be talking to a creeper when you really, this is exspecially dangerous girls and @PERCENT3 of girls chat and only @PERCENT4 of guys chat so it is more likely for girls to be talking to bad guys. This is why one thinks computers are bad for our society. When you are always can you are out as you do not get outside as much so your system is not as built up. You also could get germs off of the key board. %@PERCENT6 of the people who come down with swine flu got it off of a computer. Computer hurt our society and are not good for them. When you have a computer you think you can not live with out it, but you can. You could get your info from an encyclopedia. Your grandparents could help you a lot with history. You could even talk to your friends on to phone, what a concept. You can get @PERCENT5 of you info not on the computer, our society does not need computers. One does not believe in computers. You go on bad sites when you are on the computer. Kids are not as healthy when they go on the computer. You are able to do everything without computers says @CAPS1 computers. Society does not need this extra thing hurting them because they don't benefit our society. I do not support computer.",8
97,"It has come to my attention people are beginning to controverse on what effect computer have on people. In my opiinon I believe computers have a had effect on people.First, many people are becoming obeast because they spend to much time on the computer instead of exercising. Next kids are starting to fail and not focus on their homework cause they waste so much time on the computer, @CAPS1 computers can cause arguments between families fighting over who goes on it when. i believe computers have a bad affect on people cause they take up the time kids could be exercising kids need to be active and get a certain amount of exrcise a day in oredr to stay healhty. Every ones so wrapped up in computers these days that they don't think to go outside. This is the cause why kids are coming and not staying in shape. Everyones so anxious to go home and get on their computer they don't even think about sports and outdoor activities anymore. Its time a stand and get people back in by limiting computer time. Computer people because kids are spending so much time on computers they don't do their homework anymore or focus on studying for /test. I believe this is the reason grades are getting so poor. Everyone's so wnated about going home on facebook talking to ther friends on aim and computer games. They don't even about their should work and the of it. I can net you if computers were taken away for a week kids start doing their school work again because they would have nothing better to do. Let's begin to getting grades back up to atleast average. Finally, computers can cause arguments between families fighting over who goes on it first, when kids get home from school theres no doubt theyw ant to go on right away. This will cause siblings to argue and parents to become stressed. Parents are stressed enough already when they come home from work they don't want un needed tension when they go home too. No computers will help releave stress off parents! After reading this I hope you come to an arguments with me. Computers are the reason kids are becoming abeast and not exercising. Second, computer cause kids to fail and not focus on their school work. LAst but not least computers can cause un wanted argument between families. Let's stop all this by getting everyone to see computers have a bad affect on people!",10
98,"Dear editor, @CAPS1 are many amazing pieces of advanced technology. A computer is one of them. Computers can be good for all sorts of things, but if you look the advantages @CAPS1 are a few disadvantages about the uses of them. Computers have become more popular over the years, more people are buying them and using them. The many if them are putting drawbacks on our lives. Based on the amount of time people spend on the computer, they are not doing or exercise, not enjoying nature, and less time interacting with family and friends. Not doing much exercising can lead to an unhealthy life. In order to stay healthy, besides eating healthful foods, a big contributor is the amount of exercise. Sitting at the computer all day involves no physical movement. It is like your body is a sleep all day. Doing nothing during the day can lead to problems with your health. People will begin to notice to maintain a healthy to balance the calories you take in with. You will burn no calories sitting at a computer. Not balancing these will lead to gain obessity. To live a longer life you to be strong. In order for your in get strong have to by doing something active. A good way is get active be going enjoying nature. The world of beautiful and. When we pay attention to the computer the beauty of nature. Sometimes spending time with nature can be really relaxing. Listening in the birds cheerping or watching can be a stress releiver. Every once in a while it is good to get in your body. Inside @CAPS1 is no. Outside, @CAPS1 is plenty. If you don't want to go outside alone, go with a family member or a friend. Family and friends help us determin who we are. In our family we special bonds with each other that in our life time. The computer takes this away. Connecting to each other will give us something to talk about. When we all get along we support each other through everything. When we spend time on the computer it doesnt allow us to connect, bond, or gather support. Even though @CAPS1 are many advantages to the computer, @CAPS1 are disadvantages that effect us more. The computer lead to less exercise, not enjoying, nature, and less interaction with family and friends. Computers are something that need to use up less time in our lives.",9
99,"Dear local newspaper editor, I heard you were finding out who supports and doesnt support computer usage. Well I support the usage because I think you can learn more with it. Also it gives you good hand-eye cordination and you can talk to the people all around the country. Here is some more ideas why I support it. Lets say you are doing your homework and theres this one math problem that you dont get. You can just go on your computer and find out steps of how to get through it. Plus you can learn about other countries or specific places or even some famous person. So lets say you want to learn about @PERSON1, you can just go on your computer, type his name in and boom, everything you want to know about him. That was a reason why I support the asage. Another reason is that if you play online games, it could be your hand-eye cordination. Also just for not games that so really you good problem. The final reason is that you can talk to people through the internet. They could be your friends, family or in another country. The people who are not supporting it said that computer time takes away time from friends and family. Well I disagree with that. Online you can chat with friends and family either through a chat room or video chat. Plus lets say you have a family member in @LOCATION1 and you want to talk to him, you can do that on the computer. That was another reason why I support it. So these were the reasons why I support the usage of the computer. It helps you learn new things, helps your hand eye cordination and you can talk to friends and family.",8
100,"I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers and technology have over all benifited our society. They help widen everyone's communication, provide new educational opertunities, and help advance businesses. Communication is a huge part of our daily lives , but sometimes it's not always easy to reach, contact with people. Computers help us stay close with family and friends because let's face it with crazy air fair prices today not everyone can afford to visit their families. With computers talking to your loved ones is just a couple of clicks away. Web cams allow you to talk and see the person you're communicating with, so it's like they're right there in the room with you. Not to mention think of all the friendships computers have saved. It's always sad when a dear friend moves but with e-mail, chat rooms, and web cams it's like your best curious towards different places, cultures and people which is why computers are so important. If you want to know about a different place all you have to do is go to @LOCATION1 and look it up, plus you canhave friends all over the world something we couldn't do with out computers. Computers have provided so many new educational opertunities for people. Think about how school use yo be the teacher would teach, stbudents would right out papers by hand, and they would have to carry around those back breaking books. Now kids can type out almost anything, have fun video projects, and head online bmooks so no one has to deal with a heavy back pack. It's also easier for teachers think of that of how hard it must have been to keep track of grades, homework, and who showed up for class that's a lot of stress on one person now everything is in an organized system. Plus kids don't have to go through hours of book research when thay can look up almost anything online. Computers also play a huge role in the business world. Large and small compinies depend on computers to keep everything organized. Yes includes pay checks, files, and customer information could you imagine what would happen if we wake up one morning and there were no computers? All the businesses would be so un origanized and unadvanced. Because of computers people stay closer, businesses can thrive, and new educational opertunities are created every day.",10
101,"Dear @CAPS1 of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 teens are online @NUM1 chatting with friends and surfing the web. I personally think we should get off the computer. If you want to talk to someone, just call them! With a computer, it can start a lot of drama too! And lastly, we should enjoy nature! So obviouly computers have a larg effect on people! Keep reading to hear my reasoning. The first reason why I think computers effect us is because we get attached to talking to people from a computer! We are use to going on facebook and @CAPS5 everyone. If you really want to talk to them, just call them. Also we need to spend time with our family. If you get off the computer, then you can see them more. So computers have a large effect on us! Keep reading to hear more. Another reason why i think teens need to get off the computer is because it can start drama. I think everyone has heard of the @ORGANIZATION1, now his son killed himself, and it had something to do with the computer. Also, a lot of people learn that saying something mean to someone through a screen is a lot easier than to there face. This all starts a lot of drama, and can really hurt someone. My last reason of why being on the computer effects people is because kids to to enjoy nature. Take a walk, go for a bike ride, do anything! You get, and dont want to do anything after sitting on the computer! You could even gain weight from just sitting looking at a screen all day. You need to get energy, go play with friends! Just get off the computer!!! So I hope I made my point clear. I would be better if you get off the computer. Just call someone is you want to talk to them. And being on the computer can start drama. Lastly, you should enjoy nature and go out side. I really hope you agree with me that we need to get off the computer.",8
102,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 computers are often useful, there are various reasons why they do not benefit the society. Computers read to inactive and overwieght people. In addition, time on the computer takes away time that should be spent with family and frineds. Lastly, computers can be extremely dangerous. Children can easily access unsafe website. this comes to show that computers are hurting our society every single day. When teens come home from school, one of the first things they do is turn on their laptop or computer. People sit down infront of the screen for hours and hours instead of being outside & working their body. As you know, obesity is certainly a problem in @LOCATION1, and computers clearly are not helping this issue. Computer addicts are too busy searching the web or playing games to get some exercise and fresh air. Instead of palying, of teens the computer. This proves that using computer too much is defenitely for. Time spent on a computer is also time spent away from family and friends. People choose to be alone on the computer over interacting with other people. This strongly interfere with social skills. Studies show that it is very important to be around your family as often as possible. However, computers make it difficult for people to be around friends and family. FInally, computers cause harm to teens everyday. Children who have free acsess to internet are often going in dangerous websites. For example, in the last week, the ""chat"" has been allows anyone to video chat with any complete stranger various websites around the world involve talking to complete strangers in amy ways this can be very harmful. Therefore, people using computers are always at risk. In conclusion, computers aren't as important as many people think. In fact. they just cause problems. Computers & laptops lead to people not exercising and becoming unhealthy. Next, computers interfer with people interacting with family and friends which can cause social problems. Lastly, computers are dangerous for everyone in various ways. Therefore, computers have a very bad effect on people all over the world. ",9
103,"How often do you use a computer a day? I barely go on, but some of are are in all the time. This doesn't benefit society. Yes, if you go on for a couple minutes a day to do research or homework it benefits you, but most of the time it makes you lazy, you don't do anything obesity is a problem and how are our future generations goint to know how to use a library. My sister is a good example. Using compters don't always us. She is on the computer from when get home from school at three till when we have to go to bed. I always wonder what she does that makes her stay on that long but all it is a computer game. How is a video game beneficial? It makes her not do anything. I always end up her chores and talking the out. This generation (@NUM1) is different then the previous ones. Childhood obesity is huge @NUM2 kids are obese from the ages of two up. This isn't only because of the food we eat but also because of the technology we have. Kids today sit around all day on the computer and using cell phones to talk to friends when you could be outside riding bikes and playing basketball. How does kids being overweight contribute to this socity? What kind of message are we sending to people if we only use the computer ot do things such as research and talking to friends, when you can walk to a library or friends house? If we always do research on the computer than are kids going to know use a library or dictionary? These would no use of the encyclepedias and alases if all you have to do is type in a word and everything you need to is right there. Some of the information might not even be acurate. How would you feel if you wrote an encyclopedia nad it's not used for anything? It wouldn't be a good feeling I know that much. Not all kids feel thesame way but what they don't know that what that day isn't getting and you supposed to get at least thiety minutes of exercise a day when some people's only source or activity is gym class. Almost all kids are probably lazier than you were as a kid, they might not have and instead be on the computer you dinner. On chat systems you might think you are talking to your friend? You won't know because you can't see who your talking to.",9
104,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 people our community use computers was an essenciail port of day-to-day. However, little do they known, the interaction between computers and humans can be negative. First of all, when going online, you discuss your thoughts with virtualpeople, rather than reel friends. Also, you do not recieve the required exercise and sunlight your body needs to provide to stay healthy. Finally, computers are a large distractron in the eyes of teenagers and students. Computers not only are negative, but decrease the ability of soeralizing in schools and other places in our community. Throught online chat rooms, facebook, and other anteractions between a group of people, can not only be harmful, but dangerous. For instance, @PERCENT1 of middle school students decide to become friends with or talk to people they never even heard of as seen before. As a result, you are trusting a figure you have never physically seen before, who might as well be sharing your personal information. Another reason that virtual negative, is because of the of socializing. Through recent studies, @NUM1 people only talk on facebook, without greeting one another in public. This can not only decrease your ability of speaking in public or in front of a group, but the idea of interacting with other people your age. Finally, virtual people on different networks can be figures that are harmful or not feel you who they. For instance, one girl from @LOCATION1 didn't know her ""bestfriend"" on facebook was a @NUM2-year-old man seeking information from her. However, the idea of no exercise appears to as important. Without exercise and the ability to get from sunlight, your body won't function properly. For instance, the required amount of hours to receive exercise is one hour per day. With on message of the goal won't be reached. reason exercise could be a top priority, because of the avaiable sunlight scientists have recently discovered that teenagers stay up late because of lock of sunlight while on the computer. As a result teen not receiving the proper sunlight but sleep grades. Finally, one last reason, is how children end even adults over the years have became choose, and overweight. The main factor is the race of sitting in front of your computer for more than @NUM3 hours a day. Exercise and socializing not only effect humans, but serve as a as well. Through online gaming and other programs on computers, these factors can serve as a huge distractions. For instance in @DATE1, @NUM4 out of every @NUM5 students didn't or forgot to do each task or assignment from school, due to computers. This both decreases and the to focus as well. Another aspect, its how teenagers are denying and disobeying chores given to them by parents. For instance, I remember being @NUM6, and telling my mother I would set the table, but was @NUM7 minutes late because of of a program. I was playing. This resulted in both a consequence and disadvantages lack responsibility one last reason, you @MONTH1 be an important stuation, but then decide to take a break. Without a time unit humans go on the internet not knowing how much time they have actually sent of it. All hree of these aspects to why computers are negative. Ever since the manufacturing of computers began all ages have been interested in the technology. However, computers are unsafe, due to virtual friends, hours of exercise have gone down, and people have continued to be distracted. Even though the world needs technology computers have their flaws.",11
105,"Do you know that the average mailing letter takes more than @NUM1 days to get to the designated area? Obviously, that is a long time for something to get to somewhere else! Computers help you get the message to the person you want to read it faster. They are great for free time and research too! @CAPS9 are a definate improvement in society! In the world of communication, @PERCENT1 of students in my school prefer the use of @CAPS1-mail and @CAPS2. I mean come on, who wouldn't like it better? I is about @NUM2 faster than old fashioned snail-mail. It is also more accurate. Letter sent through the mail have to go through different post offices and then a mailman has to deliver through all of that the letter @MONTH1 get damaged, it could be loss, or it could to the wrong house! Machines are a lot more accurat in getting to the absolute destination. I have to admit, I do spend alot of time online. But most of it is not bad for me. In my I go on website, I of the stories people write about ! It's a great me. In addition kids get together and play outside, if theyre always calling, the phone will be tied up. What's the solution to this? Mentioned before were @CAPS1-mail and @CAPS2. kids can interact the phonebill. Computers are also great for sharing digital pictures. You can send those is an @CAPS1-mail too!. Imagine this, your teacher give you a research paper that is due in @NUM1 days. You run to the library but all of the subject have been checked out! What do you do? Of course, you to use the @CAPS9 for gathering information. There are some really cool websites for that. They have experts behind them that get kids information and online for everone to know! When kids don't have the neatest handwrinting, the paper @MONTH1 look sloppy even though they worked hard on it. With typing and printing, the papers automaticly look better than if they used it. Fare it, Computers are just better for. Say ""@CAPS6 More"" to snail mail, and ""@CAPS7"" to @CAPS1-mail. Dont be scared when the library has @CAPS6 books on what your looking to research. Not @CAPS10 on the @CAPS9 bad. I know you agree with me, @CAPS9 are a great improvement to @CAPS10!",9
106,"Computers help people learn about other places. They help meet people online even, but computers shouldnt be used every second of the day. Instead of watching a screen for most of the day people should go exercise, see nature, and enjoy the company of family and friends. Using a computer all day can make people fat because of the lack of exircise. So the computer can help you with research, or information on current events, but can it make thin just by stairing at a screen? Dr. @DR1 stated"" @CAPS1 is growing to be very common in the average home, and part of the reason is people are using there computers way to much."" People should be out running or looking plants. Looking at nature is beautiful and it keeps many off the computer. Some prefer watching insects roam more then a computer game. Nature is intresting to watch and it will keep you active. Computers can ruin your eyes and a plant or an insect or a tree cant do that. If your on a computer for to long you could have a seizure while you are on it. Nature cant to that while your outside. People should see and enjoy there family and friends as often as possible. If you stay on a computer for hours you seem like an old hermet not seeing anyone. Family and friends are very important. Seeing them will make both you and them happy. A computer is no friend it can be addictive. Even if a computer seems like the only thing to do, go out with some friends. Computers can be fun, and help get your walk done, but they can be bad too. If you feel the use to go on the computer right it and go exirsice, or explore nature, or even go with some friends, just dont go on the computer.",8
107,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4't you like to have a lower electric bill each month? What about saving the planet? Imagine trying to have a conversation with your child and they don't respond because their glued to the computer screen. The issue to grapple with is, would you like to have a face to face conversation with someone than them being glued to the computer. I strongly suggest that we all do the green thing and shut are computers off and enjoy the beauty of nature. Without a doubt computers are grate but the take away from family time. Second, not enough kids are exercizing because of them. Lastly, people arn't gitting enough fresh air, from the outdoors. People and families all around the world don't talk with their families enough any more. I know when I am talking to a family member or friend I would rather do it face to face than me looking at them and their looks at the computer screen. I could remember a time when a friend of mine was mindlesley watching the computer screen and something just killed her computer and thats when she realized that your family matters more than looking up pointless stuff on the internet. I know states all over the country are complaining about child obeseaty and people not getting enough exercise. If some states provide schools with computes than why cant the provide them with healthy food as well. Don't you like the satisfaction of a good run or lifting a few wates? Why would you then go sit in front of the lousy computer. Imagine being over weight in highschool and a computer geak. So go out today and lose @NUM1 pounds for your next highschool reunion. Shouldn't we all do the green thing and just shut off our computer and enjoy the beautiful nature raight out side. @PERCENT1 of the reason that scientest predict our beautiful eart @MONTH1 die in @DATE1 is because of to many non degradable electronic devices such as computers. ""I sure would like to finish the eighth grade"" says young @NUM2 grade student @PERSON1. I say we let him. Without a doubt computers are an excelent helpful tool but they are destroying our @NUM3 of a kind earth. Imagine what the sports teams would look like if all the kids layed of the computer and goined a sports team. I strong ly advise that more and more people should shut their computer off and walk away. More kids need to exercise and socelize with their family. Lastly they should enjoy nature before its all gone. Now is the time to do the green thing before its to late. The issue to graple with is to you believe that computers have a negative affect on society or not. So go out today and shut your computer off!",10
108,"Dear local Newspaper, I think computers have great effects on people. People could learn a lot from computer. Some say that computers make people more lazy but I think that is only for a person the already is lazy Not everyone. Computers help people learn about things more effectfully unlike textbooks. When learning on a computer you learn about things in a fun way by playing games or watching movies, you could learn about faraway people and places a lot easier. Computers help people talk to their family and friends easy even if you are in @LOCATION1 and your friend moved away to texas you could video chat or @CAPS1 @CAPS2 fast and fun. It could help with hand-eye coordination when playing games because you move the mouse fast and you press @CAPS3 fast and could help you with hand-eye coordination. Some people say that computers make people lazy on computers you can play an exercise video and work out while you are on the computers. Computers have made many people happy you can and print then and then a lot then typing them. Computers help @CAPS4 find cures and medical advances to cure sick people. Many Computers help people work from home so they could take care children. Computers help manage their money, without computers a lot of things have ever came about.

109,"Dear local newspaper, I am writing to you today about how i feel about ocmputer. I think computers are very dangerous. You need to be caustious about what you post on websites, you should only talk to your friends and family (never anyone you don't know), and if other people are harassing you over the internet you must @CAPS2 @CAPS3. Talking in open chat rooms can be very dangerous. People in those chat rooms could to you about your age, trick you so you @CAPS2 them everything about you, and then are day finally meet them in person. Now a day, people are getting killed, raped and who knows what else because parents don't relize their child is talking to strangers in chat rooms. Things like open chat rooms can be and are extreamly dangerous. You need to be more cautious about these chatrooms. Identity theft is happening alot more these days. E-mails that track you saying their you credit card company or even pop-ups that say you wan stuff. Some people, don't relize that the're fake! Once you enter all you information in such as, @CAPS1, address, phone number, social security, or credit card number, you will never be able to get that information back. This is how most peoples identity gets stolen. So, don't let those e-mails, and pop-ups trick you. The internet is most popular for cyber bulling. Cyber bulling is when you are , or harassing @CAPS3 or even a group of people. Myspace, facebook and e-mailing is how most cyber bulling is done. The person who is bulling people normally hides their identity so you wont find out who it is. This is a major problem. When you recieve things that you think is like bullying, threaining or @CAPS3 haunting you @CAPS2 @CAPS3!! Don't wait until the problem get worse, you must @CAPS2 @CAPS3 right away. This way if you @CAPS2 @CAPS3, they could stop it imeditaly. In conclusion, I think the computer is unsafe. The computer can be very dangerous and if you don't watch you children while they are on the computer, they could be in danger. They @MONTH1 even be getting cyber buillied, or even entering information on websites that they shouldn't. I hope that my opinions about computers persuaded you to agree with me.",8
110,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1! @CAPS1! @CAPS1! Do you hear that, thats the sound of a computer. I am trying to say people are always on there computer. I believe people should spend less time on the computer. Here are my reason why, it could damage your brain. You would be less focus in school. Lastly you will forget things. Have your head started to hurt? Well I know what is one problem and it is computers. If you stoped on a computer for @NUM1 hours straight then your eyes would start to hurt and eventually your brain will be hurting too. Study shows that @PERCENT1 of people who are on the computer for to long will start feeling pain in their head. Well I believe that if you stay on the computer to long then you will just get a pain in your head.""@CAPS2! @CAPS2! Oh yeah! What is the answer to the question?"" Have you been off focus and thought about something else? Well most likely you are thinking about a computer. If so then stop thinking about it. Computers can get you off task in class sometimes because you probably are worried about who would be on facebook or not. In this case a computer can get you no where in school so what is the point in thinking about. My final reason is computer can make you forget things like homework or projects. This is bad and not good for your grades. in an instant your grades would go down if you forget things. The cause of this is when you have something to do for school then you would say I will do it later and go on the computer. Well once you get off you might think you have nothing to do because you absorb to much tofu, on the computer. In the end computers can hurt you a lot from school to all sorts of things. I believe people should spend less time and do something else like sports. I urge you to agree with me.",8

And @CAPS1 use them to keep in touch with our friends and family. You @MONTH1 not @CAPS10 it's true, but it is. Have you ever needed to research something? If you have, I am almost @PERCENT1 sure that you used a computer to do it. How do I know this? I know this because it's only common sense to use a computer.

113,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern, I stand firm in my belief that technology benefits society. Mostly computers I for one use computers everyday and while I don't really get out much, I don't spend all my time on this machine. First of all, computers provide things for children and aults to do and that helps to lessen crime on the streets. Less crime means happier citizens and less garvage effectively keeping the cities a lot nicer. More people would go out with a definate purpose and might not get involved in some activities they could have if they just wandered around aimlessly. Another reason is that computers provide a way to help contact people you wouldn't meet any other way. There are many sites like deviant art and youtube that can help to find people like that and they also provide a way of getting people together who have mutual interests. I have made a few friends this way myself when I otherwise would normally avoid people in the real world. Lastly, my computer has been able to help me learn various things. I have been able to help my fictional writing by reading fanfiction on the internet. I have also been able to teach my self basic japanese through articles and songs. Actually, I've even been able to teach myself how to access my lower singing range through aforementioned japaness songs. Therefore the internet gives me an outlet to practice my many hobbies. In conclusion I think computers can benefit society in numerous ways. These machines have certinly helped me out during life. I know there's a way to balance real life and play time and we can only hope veryone will find it too.",8
114,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Have you ever thought of how many people are using computers thes days? The number of computer user has increased by so much since the beginning of the creation. I have to say computers can definetly be helpful, but think of all the down falls computers have also kids can go online to sites and talk to complete strangers, instead of doing other things like chores or going inside they stay inside on the computer, and children, particularly, choose to play games on them instead of homework. Now would you like this going on in your house? Online sites like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and plain old chatrooms enable children of any conversational age to talk to strangers. On these sites groomers (adults that pretend to be children to get personal info) can be found. Children @MONTH1 not know the dangers of these kind of people so they can fall into the trap. Kids @MONTH1 also lie of their age to get older people to talk to them which can be a bad idea. For it is considered fraud. Some people in chatrooms like to cyber bully also. Cyber bullying can cause a minor depression, which can lead to dangerous acts or even suicide. ""Not now, @CAPS3 I'm playing a game!"", ""I'll be down in a little while"", and ""I'm busy"". Are these statements you hear from your children while they're on the computer? I know my @CAPS3 surely hear it, and it gets annoying! Kids under the age of @NUM1 these days are on the computer so much playing games and talking to friends we barely do anything else, anymore. Back when there weren't any computers kids would play sports, go outside, or even help out around the house. Ever since computers came out though more and more children are sticking to the online-indoor life. This lifestyle can lead to health problems, and who wants those? If you look at our homework list we do not get alot of it but the question: is why isn't this little amount of homework getting done? The answer to this is partically computer's faults. Particularly children these days are picking to go on the computer before or even instead of doing homework. We tell ourselves ""@CAPS4 yeah I'll only go on for @NUM2 minutes then do my homework right after"", but then we forget. Yeah, computers can help us, but they can also drag us down. Missing homework can lead to bad grades, which can lead to a slighter chance of getting into a good college. So, you @MONTH1 be saying computers are still good and helpful, but at least you also got to see the negatives of them. Children talking to strangers, spending more time on the computer then anything else, and using them instead of homework, are all not fantastic qualities. You can still use computers, but at least consider the idea of safer computers, and time charts. In can not only help out your lives but your kid's lives also.",10
115,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 some people @MONTH1 say that computers are harmful, I strongly believe they benifit society a lot. Three reasons why are, people can develop important typing skills which can be helpful for jobs. Students can use computers as a good source for reasearch and projects, and it's a fun and easy way to connect with friends, or even faraway family. The first reason I chose is that people can develop important typing skills, which can be very helpful when you go on job interviews. "" A lot of big, highpaying, important jobs require knowing to type well"", says rich buisness man, @PERSON1. If you go into a job interview without "" typing well"" on your resumay, then there is deffinitly a smaller chance of you getting the career you want. Another important reason that shows computers are beneficial to societly, is that they help with research for projects and school. Some people would say books are the way to go for reasearch, but computers are faster, easier, and overall more fun and intresting to use. Do your really want students being bored, and unmotivated for school?! My last reason is that using computers can help people connect with others. There's millions of different ways to that fit everybodys needs to communicate with friends and even far away family. For example, my laptop helped my family connect with my cousings, aunt, and uncle from @ORGANIZATION1. We even web chatted with them on @ORGANIZATION2! Don't you think communicating and connecting with long lost familly is amazing? As you can see, computers don't hurt or harm people... They actually do the exact opposite. Computers, help people to develop typing skills for jobs, make it enjoyable and simple to do projects and research, and are a great way to reconnect with family, and connect with friends.",9

I thnk computers arent even ncoded anymore. We all have major good phones that have better and smarter things on them that just do the exact same thing. You could be walking while your using it. I excercise daily, i think it's important to be healty and strong. People spend way to much time on the computer and don't excersice. If you dont excercise bad things are going to happen to your body and your going to see physical changes. What ever happed to books? In the writing prompt topic it talks about how give us an ability to learn but that doesnt matter. We all need exercise to keep off going and keep us from out. Even if the computer gives us abilitys too. I think computers put to much importan us and its less with information.

The presededt @ORGANIZATION1 computers seds that @PERCENT3 @ORGANIZATION1 all computers are now being made with wed cams in turn for communication purposis. Would can rather pay @MONEY1 a month for a phone bill when you could be using your laptop computer for free? Computers can also be used as an entertainment divice. I can use my @ORGANIZATION2 laptop for playing movies and music and computer games on @CAPS2 or online. But I'm not the only person how dos this because @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 people with computers uses them for entertainment. @PERSON1 the precedent @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION2 said that computers these days are being made to play movies on your computer beter than on your huge @MONEY1 inch plasma screen @CAPS3. So why would you spend @MONEY2 on a @MONEY1 inch @CAPS3 if you could just spend @MONEY3 on a desent laptop and whache @CAPS3 and moveis right on your laptop? Would you want your child to be the only one that cant resarch and cant talk to people and not be able to whach @CAPS3 without rasing the cadle bill?",9
118,"Dear Local Newspaper, I also believe that computers have a positive effect on people, and here are my reasons why. It helps people learn new things, about the earth, animals, nature, and other things. Say your son or daughter doesn't know anything about the digestive system and they have to do a report for school. They can look it up on the computer and learn everything about it. Some people say that people spend to much time on the computer and doesn't exercise or interact with their family. Well people can make a scheduele for computer time and time other things like exercising and spending time with family. It also gives kids something to do when they cant go outside. They can go on the computer, because I rather have a child go on the computer than them playing violent video games. It also helps people keep intouch with friends, because if your friend moved or one of your parents are on a buisness trip. You can use the computer to talk to them or see them on the webcam. Those are the reasons why I think computers have a positive effect on people",7
119,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 you know how badly the computers are effecting people? Computers are just a lazy way of keeping contact with people. The effects are spending more time on the computer than enjoying nature, less exercising, and interacting with family and friends. Now lets go on to enjoying nature than being on the computer all the time. Why don't you enjoy nature instead of being on the computer? Exploring nature is so much fun. Nature is a great way to meet new people and experience new stuff that you never seen before. You don't want to sit at a desk all day fooling around on the computer. It gets boring after being on the computer so long, but nature, you will never get bored. Enjoying nature is a great way to enjoy your life not wasting it on a computer. Since I wrote about nature, lets move on to exercising more. You don't want your body just sitting there on a chair all day long, @CAPS3 you? No, you want to exercise more with your body. All your doing is exercising your fingers, but why not use your whole body. Being on the computer is not going to help your body exercise at all. Go outside, and at least ride your bike a couple of miles. When you go exercising, you can at least get that blood flowing. Lastly, people should interact with your family and friends more often. Interacting with family and friends is more important than being on a computer. Keeping up with your family and friends is a very important thing because your family are the people that is closest to you and your future family. As us people know, friends come and go, but that is not a reason to have a couple of friends to hang out with. Some people might loose your family and friends by sitting at a computer all the time and not keeping in contact with them. Always interact with your family and friends. Spending too much time on a computer is a waste of time. It effects people by not enjoying nature, not exercising, and not interacting with family and friends. Now that you've heard my opinion, what @CAPS3 you think of it now?",8
120,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, The creation of computers has greatly effected society. People are now connected to each other around the world. I believe this advancement in technology should be welcomed and embraced. Computers teach valuable skills including hand-eye cordination. People can reach information instantly. Lastly, the speed and quality of communication has increased ten fold. To start off, computers are great tools for learning. Young children learn hand-eye cordination by using the mouse while looking at the screen. Sometimes they learn this skill amazingly well. In the medical field, surgery is no longer done by hand, but with elaborate machines controlled by computers. @PERSON1, a @NUM1 year old student of @LOCATION2 in @LOCATION3, is studing to become a surgen. He is amazing with the computer system, not distancing many professional doctors with the new equipment. ""@CAPS1 is all because,"" scientist who have studied @PERSON1 say, ""he used computers sence he was little. This means he has an advanced sence of how they work and what to do when."" This prodigy was born because of computers.The talent of surgens greatly benefits society because better doctors means healthier people. Computers also benefit the information the internet. ""You have @NUM2 messages in your inbox,"" the window says as @CAPS1 pops onto my screen. I open my email, having not checked @CAPS1 for a day. @CAPS1 is filled to the with messages from @LOCATION4, telling me how far away my order is from my house I have an e-mail from @ORGANIZATION2, an article about the @CAPS2 rover. There is another e-mail from my orchestra teacher, reminding the class that the permission slip is due tommrow. All this would not be possible without computers. In a single second, I can know the headline news in @LOCATION6, or @LOCATION1. I can look at pictures from the @CAPS3 countryside, or a live feed from a submarine at the bottom of the ocean. The research for my social studies project was done in an hour with online rather than stay libray. The computer saves time. This means people have more time to exercise and enjoy nature when the monitor is turned off. Would you rather get in a dark, dark libray all day or enjoy the wonders of the world with a click of your hand, and still be in your own backyard to play outside? Also, people can acess data from around the world. Information on how to cook an @CAPS4 dish is available in @LOCATION5. Along with that, medical records are available every where, meaning all information can be combined to get a bigger picture of what your health issue maybe. Computers also improve the quality of comunication. Statistics show that in moder times, @PERCENT1 of meetings take place on a lap top, not in a board room. With video chatting, all of your partners can appear on a single screen sitting on your lap. You can answer and ask questions face to face from opposite sides of the world. This amazing feat would not be possible without computers. Instant messaging also allows for text to be transfer instantly over vast distances. Documents that would have otherwised been forced to send by mail appear at the speed of light in your inbox. This means instead of important documents taking weeks to appear, @CAPS1 takes seconds allowing the things that need to get done to be finished. Schools can take advantage of this by keeping digital copys of worksheets and other important documents insted of physal paper copies. This means less trees are killed. When trees are cut down, they no longer produce oxygen or remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. With meetings taking place on a monitor, people no longer waste fossil fuels trying to get there, sence cars also produce carbon dioxide. Thus, using computers is better for the environment. @NUM3 out of @NUM4 people say they prefer sending an email to sending a letter, due to the fact that letter costs money. Computers also alow for more interaction between people. If your father or mother is on a busness trip you can still say goodnight face to face. You can send an e-mail to your sister at college, who never answers her phone due to the time difference. Overall, computers make the world smaller, allowng for better means of communication. Computers are amazing peices of equipment, and I belive, they are a great benifit to society. They teach valuable skills, alow for fast and easy access to information and faster quality communication. Overall, the advancement of computers has benifited, and will benifit society greatly.",12
121,"In my opinion I think computers are good to have and my three resons are that computers help people be able to learn about new things, talk to friends and family that live far away, and can help you find jobs and help you with your job. My first reason is that computers help people be able to learn about new thing like famos people and places which not many people really want to read a book to learn about when they get go online and see pictures and learn all they need to know about also you can learn new ways to prevent getting sick and how you can treat it @CAPS1 you already are. My second reson is that people can talk to friends and family that live far away because not many people always have time to grab a phone and call them but they do have time to email them. So computers can help keep you together with your frieds and family you rarely ever see. My third reson is that computers can help you find a job but @CAPS1 you already have one it can help you with it because lots of jobs these days use computers for lots of things like money for banks, for kids in school, stuff like that they can help you find a job by showing you different jobs that you can do or what you have to do to be able to do that job you have always wanted to do. In cunclusion I think computers are good and my three resons again are that computers help people learn about new thing, helps you stay togather with frieds and family that live far away, and help people find jobs but @CAPS1 they already have one computers help with the job.",8
122,"Dear Newspaper, I'm sure you use computers a lot, typing up your articles. Many people in this world now use computers. There are people that work on computers sit on the @CAPS2 all day as their job. You can find so many things on the internet & @CAPS2 I think computers are a positive effect on the society because you can interact, helps the environment and people, and helps remember things. First, computers now are very important and useful. There is always so many kinds of websites that you can meet you date or catch up with you family members. There is many people using facebook and myspace. Now you can instant message them to talk to them @CAPS1, you can find old friends or people in college. Secondly, some people might say oh, @CAPS8 you're on the @CAPS2 you have no social skills but you @CAPS6 you type and talk to people. You even improve your writing skills. @CAPS5, it helps with hand eye coordination. There are many people that has no hand eye coordination like me. When you look at the screen you have to move you hand to get the mouse where you want it. Computers @CAPS1 help you type faster @CAPS8 you type a lot you get practice, just talking to a friends you even improve. These are my reasons why I think computers help our society in interaction. Secondly, @CAPS2 now have everything you can think of from buying food at @CAPS3 & @CAPS4 to textbooks, all you have to @CAPS6 is search it on goodle and there it is. @CAPS8 more people use the textbooks online, than printing @NUM1 page books will @CAPS3. This means it will help the environment. People @CAPS3 cutting down trees because more people are using online books that means animals will keep their home. Secondly, you might think computers give radition, well more & more computers are trying to fix that, to help your heath so its not a danger to be on computers @CAPS5, @CAPS8 more people are buying and using computers they will need more jobs to help build them and sell them. Right now there are alot of people without jobs. So @CAPS8 you keep computers popular there will be a lor more jobs. These are my reason why computers are good for the environment % people. @CAPS5, people can remember things @CAPS8 they have really good memory. For me, I don't have good memory. And i know a lot of people that don't as well. Well that's where computers come handy. There is a button you press on mac computers and it pulls up a ""TO @CAPS6"" @CAPS7 and you can just type in whatever it will be there so you won't have to miss place the paper. Secondly, @CAPS8 you have a @NUM2 page essay you wrote on paper put it in your binder the holes can break and the paper is lot. Then when the teacher ask you where it is you have no clue, @CAPS8 you typed it you can go back in saved files and print it out. You have it. The good things is you get an A not a @CAPS9! @CAPS5, computers you can set something where it tells you every hour to @CAPS6 something. So while your on the @CAPS2 it will say one hour pasted and you can go @CAPS6 whatever you needed to @CAPS6 every hour these are my reason why computers help you remember things. As you can see, there is a lot of positive things when you buy a @CAPS2. There are many people that use computers are a positive effect on the society because you can interact helps the environment & people and helps to remember things.",11

124,"Dear, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I believe that we benifit from computers. We do because computers can benefit society and benefit just regular people. Computers are a great way of comunication for people all over the world. But their not just for communication. Computers benefit society because they help the @LOCATION3, comunicate with places like @LOCATION2 or @LOCATION1 who both reasently had earthquakes and instead of a place to find out what they need, come back, get everything together, then going back to its to discover for @MONEY1 of people. We can just click a name and they can tell @LOCATION3 what they need. It also benefits society because the place could go undercover and actually talk to a criminal. He would be able to find out important things like where he lives, his name, people he is with and then they could go and arrest everyone. That has actually happened many times. Computers can also help regular people. Computers can help regular people because they can tell you @CAPS3 with regular updates instead of one in the papers. For example if the newspaper says light snow"". That is what I will prepare for. But what if it takes a turn for the worse; I want the storm hits and then it will be to late. but with the internet I can do @CAPS3.com and I'll know the @CAPS3 worse. Also I would use it to keep in touch with my cousins from so instead of paying @MONEY1 to go see them I can videochat or email them, for free. There are just some of the reason computers benefit everyone. Computers are great for so many reasons more than benefiting and regular people. Computers can be for any thing finding what means to helping @LOCATION2. Computers are amazing things.",8
125,"Dear @CAPS1 newspaper, @CAPS2 the web, chatting with a friend @NUM1 miles away who you haven't seen in so long, or skyping with your dad while he is on a buisness trip. These are all terrific ways a computer can be used. Now imagine not being able to do any of these things. The computer is a wonderful advancement in technology! Many buisnesses today relie mostly on one. If we didn't have computers many people wouldn't have a job. I believe computers benefit society because they help you contact people. If you need them ergently, are a great pass time on a miserable winter day, and are a reliable sorce of information. To start off computers benefit society because they let you stay in contact with people miles away and contact them quickly if it is ergent. I mean imagine being in a whole other country for a few weeks where your phone doesn't work. If you have a computer you don't have to worry about spending a lot of money buying or using one. A @CAPS3. @PERSON2 from the local newspaper states; ""@PERCENT1 of travelers going on buisness trips bring a laptop, @PERCENT2 of travelers going to another countrey for anything bring their laptop."" This shows that without computers contacting people would be @NUM2 times harder. Additionally, having computers in todays day and age is beneficial to our society because when it is winter and it is way to cold out to think of stepping out the door a computer can be a great pass time. To catch up with friends and family, to organize up coming events, or to just play a game. Even when your sick a computer can be fun. When you are sick you are required to stay in bed. What else would you do other than watch t.v. or go on your computer? As @PERSON1 @CAPS4 in the daily current; ""In the winter computers are used @NUM3 times more."" This concludes that having a computer is a great pass time. Finally, having computers is benifitial to our society because they are a reliable sorce of information. When you are doing homework, or research for your job, computers can save you time and money. Instead of taking ten to twenty minutes in your day and driving @NUM4 miles to a library or your office. You could be saving money on gas and valuable time in your day. Instead you can just log on to your computer and look it up on google. This takes about two to five minutes. As @CAPS3. Gizmo states; ""The average @CAPS6 can save over @MONEY1 a year by using a computer instead of a car. This is why having a computer is benifitial to the society. In conclution computers are very helpful on a day to day basis. Whether you are contacting a friend or family member, or it's to cold to go outside and you are bored, or you need information in a short amount of time, computers can help with many things. Thank you for taking time out to read this. I hope you take it into consideration.",10
126,@ORGANIZATION1. I believe that computers are a good thing. They are good because they help you in school. They also can help organized and last you can use laptops go places. I know that I use a computer in school everyday. I use this for research on people I dont know like @PERSON1 @CAPS1. @LOCATION1. This brings me to my next point. I also use it for papers I will need to type my paper. This will enable me to write and then save all my work. Not only can the do that but also can keep your paper neat. I don'@CAPS1 have good hand writing so I type my paper. This keeps my work neat. I love computers because they keep you organized. I can have all my work from @NUM1 years ago on a hard drive so I am organized. Also I only have @NUM2 file so I need to have all this stuff in my binder @CAPS2! I just save it on my file. You can also stay organized by using with to transfor things to a diffrent computr or laptop. This will definetly keep me organized. I am horrified that people don'@CAPS1 like computers. You get so much use out @ORGANIZATION1 that like with laptops you can take them with you anywhere. I went to @LOCATION2 and took my laptop and I worked on my schools paper. It helped a lot. They also let you talk to friends and family that you cant usually talk to because you don'@CAPS1 live close. So you can keep in touch with them. I hope that now people love desktops and laptops just a much as I do. Because they help with school staying organized and they have different varietiys and they are on the go. So please keep computer alive.,8
127,"Dear Local Newspaper: In my opinion, computers have a negative effect on most people. I think this because the internet can give false information; staring at a computer screen all day can cause eye damage; and a person who sits in front of a computer all day can become fat and unhealthy. Continue reading for more details on the opinion... My first reason I think computers have a negative effect on people is because the internet can give false information. For example, if you type in ""dogs"" into a search box on @ORGANIZATION1, you can get results about cats. Did you know that anybody in the world (who owns a computer) can go onto the internet and make a website and false information? Twenty-five precent of internet websites that were meant for learning distribute false information. My next reason I think computers have a negative effect on people is because it could cause eye damage. Studys show that if you sit in front of a computer all day that your ability to see will decrease, little by by little. It's only a matter of time before your eyesight is either poor or completely gone. Another study showsthat @PERCENT1 of teenagers are ""addicted"" to playing video games or being on the computers all day. That's @PERCENT1 of our future generation who will probably not be able to see very well or at all by the time they're @NUM1 or @NUM2 years old. Is that the kind of future you want? My third and final reason I think computers have a negative effect on people is because a person can become fat and unhealthy. These people could chow down on a bag of chips, which have thousands of calories, and not exercise or anything to exort all these calories. Those stored calories will build up and turn into fat cells, and clog arteries and veins and cause massive heart attacks and strokes. In conclusion, there is an extremely negative affect on sitting in front of computer all day for the following reasons: the internet could give you false information; it could decrease eye sight and; these people could become fat and unhealthy. Please take my opinion into consideration.",9
128,"Dear, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I thank that a lot of people uses the computer everyday. For me, I spend a bit of time on the cumputer as somedays. I do sprite comily, write staring, and check information on the internet, and I some times chat with my friends.I enjoy a lot. its in @DATE1 that I go around connec ticut to find the things in nature, like survival. I made a few hunting bows and arrows for me when I can go around the world and survive the elements with some help frum . For studies at home I use the computer for research whether . There really powerful and collect a lot of jewery in rush time. When they wrer extinct they still were cool. In other researches I found a few things fun some health benefits. Theres always some good things fun computers like improving hand eye coordination, music, arts, etc, everytime they use the computers there fingers start getting faster evrytime. Well my last reason and answer is that I agree that using computers is good for something and bad for your hand and eye sight.",7
129,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 you agree that computers benefit your society? Those who support advances in technology believe that computer have a positive effect on people. Instead of being in side on the computer allday you can get some exercise. You can go for a walk. You can go have a social life and hangout with you friends. Would you agree that being on the computer benefits society? Instead of being in the house on the computer all day you can go to the gym. Going to the gym can help you stay healthy. It can also help you stay in shape then you might be able to fit into that stress you bought that was two tight. Also, you might meet a nice man at the gym. So instead of bing on facebook or aim all day get up and go to the gym. Maybe you should go for a walk rather than sit on the computer. Sitting on the computer will just make you fat. Going for a walk daily will make you skinney and healthy. Also, going for a walk daily will help strengthen your bones and mucsles in your legs. Try going for a walk daily instead of sitting on the computer and eating chips all day. Get a life, don't sit on the computer all day. Go have a lunch date with your friends. You might want to take walk with your friend. Have fun going out with your friends. You might want to the bowling alley. So have fun and get a life. So now @CAPS4 you think computers benefit your society? Those who support advances in technology blieve that computers have a positive effect on people. So go the gym make your body be wanted. Take your dog for a walk and watch how it helps your bones and muscles stronger. Get a life go @CAPS4 something with your friends and have a fun time.",8
130,"Dear Newspaper, Have you ever asked yourself if computers benfit our society? Think about it, everybody uses a computer atleast one hour a day some people are on the computer all day and night. We all rellay so much on computers that if we stop using computers we might not be able to function. We use computers to communicate, store information, keep track of information, tracking shipments, running bisness. Computers are a tool they can help you but they can hurt you to if you are to dependent on computers. You have to be careful how much you rellay on the computers. Also there are criminals who use the computers to hurt you so you have to be careful about what information you put the computer. In conclusion, computers can help and harm you for many defferent reasons. That is why I belive that we shouldn't rellay so much on the computer that we can't function without them. That is why we can't rellay so much on computers.",6
131,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Are computers helping or hurting? When most people gaze at a lit-up computer screen, they are most likely alone, not excercising, or showing any individual personality. Soon if we continue focusing @CAPS4 time on computers. We will be disconnected from friends, rather that connecting, like those social networks do. Computers are a individual pastime. Multiple people are not ""tweeting"" off of the same computer together. Therefore, you @MONTH1 be talking through electronics to them, but you lack face-to-face experiences. A research was done by @PERSON1, at @LOCATION1, that states @PERCENT1 of children born in the @DATE1 to present will be socialy incapeable by their late @NUM1 due to ""isolation socialization"". We don't want to lose the abilit to connect with the closest to us. Consequently, if we are not experiencing face-to-face talks - there is no personality needed to carry a conversation. Uniqueness is what we're all about! my sister married a hardworking @CAPS1. @NUM2 years ago coming up on their sixth anniversary, their marriage isn't going so well. Last year @CAPS3 recently got a @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 can't stay off it. In the words of my sister- ""@CAPS3 doesn't engage in family moments anymore, and has become a ""robot"". I am starting to fear @CAPS3 won't be a good father for @CAPS4 @NUM3 mont baby on the way. @CAPS3 just never gets off the computer."" @CAPS4 personality change could hurt the ones around us. Techknowledgy is advanced bu that advanced. We are not able to search the web while running or playing a sport. We have to opt out of excercise to do the things your body wants to do. The only body parts moving in typing are your fingers and your hands. That just doesn't cut it. Soon well be the fat, lazy. Space ment women from @CAPS5-@CAPS6 the movie. They just float around in chairs videochating with people and doing other things on their tus/computers. They don't leave their chair once to stop their activity. Therefore they have forgotten how to walk. To answer you questions, computers are hurting us. They are blackholes that suck the personality out of us, and isolate us. We are equivalent to lifeless blobs of accumiliating, fat, when hypmotize by a computer.",9
132,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the effect(s) computers have on people is that computers can have both a negative and positive effect. From @CAPS1 opinion I lean more towards negative even though I do enjoy computers. @CAPS1 reasons for why I lean more towards negative is because it's a waste of time, you could get put into very dangerous situations, and not thinking properly. @CAPS1 first reason why I think computers are a negative effect on people is because it's a waste of time. Instead of using your time wisely with activities you could or should do your on the computer. You should be writing your five page essay but instead your on facebook or playing an online game. When your on the computer is distrants you from work you must be doing, which is important and will just be a mess later on. This is a situation I can also relate to. I suppose to be writing a paper for english class but instead I was playing on the computer and wasted over an hour and could've just got @CAPS1 paper done with. @CAPS1 second reason why computers have a negative effect on people is because you could get put into very dangerous situations. Some people think chat rooms are fun and nothing bad could ever happen but chat rooms are very dangerous. Thousands of online predators try talking to kids younger and meet them in person, which is extremely dangerous. Many people out there try to harm other humans emotionally and physically. So you never want to try talking to strangers in any way because it can lead you into a bad situation down the road. @CAPS1 third reason why computers have a negative effect on people is because it takes away your energy and you don't think properly when on the computer you tune out everything around you and not pay as close attention to things like you should. Even though computers can be fun you should take a break and do something even more useful such as a physical activity. Computers can distract you from doing physical work your body needs which leads to lazyness. Lazyness is not healthy for your body and can cause you to a health related problem and you @MONTH1 need medical attention. So as you see computers can be very negative towards people and cause many problems. I hope you keep in mind what I have written.",9
133,"Dear To who this @MONTH1 consirn, Computers… They are great for when it comes to projects, papers, and fun. I think that computers have a sum what good effect on people because up untill a few years ago most people didn't even know how to use a computer. Now a days computers help people in many ways, they help with reports and projects. Computer keep getting better and better as the years go by. Now they have edvanced enternet, and have even added a new edvanced microsoft word, you can do powerpoints, brosures, and even invitations. Computers had had a great effect on people because some people have children that they have to take care of all day or when they get home from work. The computer can help entertain children. Children can go and play games, watch moves or depending on their age even connect with friends. One of the features of the computer has made a big effect on people is the webcam. The webcam has helped people connect with old friend, distint relitives, or eyed a child thats off at school. As you can see computers had effected people in many ways. But one other reason is work. Some people work from home so they can be a stay at home parent or even take care of someone close. Either way they stay connected with, emplyies, they boss, or even clients. People take alot of vacations, but they also work, so they just bring their laptop with them and their ready to go. So as you can see computers had effected peoples lifes in big ways, weather its work, entertaing kids, or just having fun. The computer is a big help to every person.",8
134,"Do you spend a lot of time on computers? Well, if so I have a suggestion to you. Limit yourself to computer time! If you don't limit yourself and stay on the computer all the time, then you will miss out on better things in life. You still don't get why I am suggesting this. Then here are some examples why. One example of why you should limit your time with computers is because you will goin weight @CAPS6 likely. College @CAPS1 from @ORGANIZATION1 observes that @PERCENT1 of people who spend a majority of their time on computers gain weight because if all you do is eat sleep and go on the computer, what exercise are you getting in that life style. This is a perfect example of why you should limit your time in computers. Aniother reason why you should limit your time on computers is that you are risking your chance of losing your friend or friends. What I mean by this is that if you have your mind get on the computer you will start to choose it our your friends and site, of what is important to you. Your friend @MONTH1 even not want to be friend any more because they are sick of being chosen over by a computer. @CAPS4 @CAPS2, creator of the computer says, ""@CAPS3 I make the computer, I was , and time my friend would call to get a drink, with me I always told him I was busy on the computer. He eventually didn't to and with I becoming obsessed the computer. ""That is know @CAPS4 @CAPS2 his : from . If you don't want to loose , your computer . My limit yopur time is because your grades will drop. pricipal , @CAPS6 of their on computers once of their because @CAPS3 student have from school, they straight the computer @CAPS3 they should be doing their homework or studying.",8
135,"Dear newspaper editor, I've been hearing alot of discussion about the computer issues. In my own opinion I feel that computers are a great thing to learn about and can really benefit from computers helps you find information alot quicker, lets you talk to family/ friends far away and also helps with alot of school assignments. People always talk about how they want to travel the world and see/visit different places well if people really wanted to find quick and easy information about that particular place. It's way easier expecally because about every house in the @CAPS1.S has a computer so many things go by faster. For exmaple say that you wanted to find some information about birds, not every person has a book about birds and time to go to the library and if you had a computer all you would have to do was look it up and have your questions answered. Alot of people are moving and when I say moving I mean far away. Alot of people wonder haw they would keep i'll touch with there family? They can write letters but it would take way to long. They could buy plan tickets to visit, but right now in this recetion nobody really has enough money to pay for it. So what's a cheaper way to talk to your family and see them as well? Webcam webcam is an easy way to talk to family and friends easally and now every labtop made has one and it is very easy to connect. It's when you able to see them and talk to them at the same time as long as you event for as long as you want. In the @DATE1 technology has grown rapidly. More technology has been put into schools, homes and even building. More school cure starting to give alot of assignments with computers needs. I've been seeing that alot of teachers have been giving us alot of writing assignments with us having to research alot of things. Also that we have to type alot of papers. They are making computers a big part of education now and making technology take part in it too. Ifee it is a good combination. To some up up my easy I do feel that computers has a big benefit to society and helps us solve alot of issues. As the years go on not just computers but alot of other electronics will be very normal to human life.",8
136,"Dear @CAPS1, I think that computers don’t have a negative effect on people. The computer can teach you about @CAPS4 things easier, and it allows you to talk to people @CAPS2, people can be on when they use the computer or not. On the computer, you can learn about anything. For example, there are @CAPS4 websites that allow you to search any topic and you will get a lot of information on that topic. @CAPS2, there are websites, such as @LOCATION1, where you can find the definition f words fast and easy. It takes along time to search through dictionary, but with this websites, you can do it much faster. @CAPS3 say that you want to buy a car, but you want to learn more about this can to make sure its the right choice. Well, with a computer you can do that I are let you learn about cars with video and more. There is no way that is a back affect @CAPS3 say you want to talk to somebody but someone else is on the phone. Computer you can go on the internet @CAPS4 sites let you chat will you find. This can be goal because a like here could happen. Its @CAPS2 guide when because @CAPS5 like to reply. People let do They said that computers have a effect on because they werent got they outside but what they use the computer. They will get bored of the computer at some point. At sometime they will run out oxf stuff to learn. Then they will go out and do activities get exercise and spend time will family and friends. I for one, do that too. When I get home from school I do my home work computer. On the computer I check a few things and then get off. After that I go and @CAPS6 you see, people know when to get off the computer and get excercise. Computers don't here a negative effect on More like they help people. They teach us stuff, helps get who quickly are talk to friends faster. everthing that a computer does is positive.",8
137,"Dear local newspaper, I have herd about a problem of computer usage. Also some benefits with the computer. But I believe that computers shouldn't be stoped being used. They help you in homework, directions, and stores which helps you a lot. First in homework you can use the computer for typing on essay. And if your not a good speller, you have the spell cheaker on microsoft office to help you. So that you dont get a @CAPS1- from all and your spelling mistakes. When you would of had a @CAPS2+ on it. A computer also helps you with homework by helping you see what was for homeworks for tonight if you forgot to wright it down or if you were sick. I now you could call a friend, but what if your friend was in a different core. So all you have to do is go onto your school website and go to the teacher's site and see whats the homework. Also a computer helps you with directions. It helps you by starting at your house to you exact locashion. So if your new to the city/suberb you don't find yourself lost, and don't know how to get back home. You just need to go to internet, then to google map and type in your house and destanashion. It shows you the rout and you can print out the directions to have it with you. And on the map it has on the side how many miles on what street/rout you need to go. So you don't have to guess. But I know there are @CAPS3's. But I don't like them. Once my uncle go a @CAPS3 an wanted to try it out when he came over to my house while he was driving. He new how to get here but, when he got on my streeet he said that the @CAPS3 folled him that he was in the woods, and didn't show a street. So thats why I stop to using computer with my directions. Lastly a computer helps you with stores. With a computer you can go to a stores website and look at what they have for close or sales etc. So you done find your self on a @NUM1 hr hunt for a toy or pair of boots when it should only take @NUM2 min. Also a computer can help you with resturant raitings. By going to the resterounts websit you can see reviews and raitings and prices of their food, and opinnions on the resturaunt. So that you don't find yourself with bad. One time I was at a resteraunt for lunch with my family. And everyone got there order except my brother @PERSON1. And the wator said it will be here soon. @NUM3 mins later he got his burger. I know thats enough time to make a burger from scrach. So they tecnicly forgot my brothers order. And we didn't give a big tip. Computers arn't bad for people. They can help you a lot. They can help with typing for homework, directions to a store and stores sales. So computers are helpfull throughout our daily lives.",9
138,"Dear Readers, @CAPS1 you @MONTH1 think that computers are fun, exciting, and the way of the future, it's not! I mean come on you can never go wrong with shopping online. That's how I felt until I got taste of my own medicine, my friend ignored me to be on the computer, and it hurt, so i decided to take a look at how it's changed everyone. Parent's and children of all age's, how many time's have you gone online and little match making pop-up appears on you screen? have you ever just to just to see who you'll if so then the parents who are reading my letter, talk to your children about the dangers of online match making. There are lots and lots or perverted adults waiting to find senceless kids to minipulate or ""chat"" with. Now children, teens, and young adults is not a making way from that in a while and visualize the @CAPS2 healthy, stay action stay away from the computer, just remember, there's always testing!",6
139,"Dear @LOCATION1 newspaper, @CAPS1 you have a bad feeling about computers? Well I @CAPS1. Over the years I've seen computers ruin peoples health and lower students grades at school. People truly would be better off with out computers. Taking walks, or going for a run, are all activitys which will keep you fit. But sitting down at a computer is not. My older brother @CAPS2 would always stay on the computer playing games on the internet for hours at a time. As days, weeks, then months went on our family began to notice alot of wait gain on him. As he began to spend less time on the internet and more time exersising he losed some weight so that @CAPS2 was health again. I've also noticed that its more tempting to eat a bag of chips then to eat a carrot while on the computer. It takes a while to prepare health food then it is with unhealthy foods. Over a peird of time all the junk food you've been eating with harm your health. Last year my friends father had a heart attach because be had too much fat blocking his heart. If he were eating good food such as carrots, chicken, and tomatos his heart attack could have been prevented. That is why my friends farther spends less time on the internet, giving him more time for health food you would never stare into a light both for hours so why would you look into a computer for that long? Dr. @PERSON1 from @CAPS4 @CAPS5"" my studies show that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS6 waring glass, eyes, have been harmed be common things like your television, and computer. I wont to live a long healthy life and will not let computer's stop me. The internet can be an important object in your adulecents life, but it can also be the most dangers. Over the years there has been about @NUM1 kidnapping in @LOCATION2 each year. My cusin @PERSON2 found a person on my space who said he was fifteen. He even had a picture of his young self on the computer. It turns out he was now forty years old. I'm not saying not going on the computer will stop you from metting these kind of people but it will precent your children from it. Not only that but computer effect your sleep. When I was in @NUM2 grade I spent hours on the computer. At school I was tierd and found it diffcult to learn. Suprisingly I wasnt the only one have trouble sleeping. A person named mike found it difficult to sleep because he always wanted to be on the internet when he wasnt on. When we both notice the internet was causing my grades to go down and harming mikes sleep. We decided not to go on any longer and tell no adult about mikes sleeping problems. With out computers the world would not be perfect but it would be a better place. I hope that you will not let computers harm you and your family. Please keep my letter and consider my idea.",9
140,I think computer's are good to use. The first reason why I think is good because if we did not have any computer's we could'nt go on @CAPS1 and all types of fun stuff I think life would be kinda boring. My second reason is life would be boring without computers is because we cound'nt comuncaite with our friends or family wat if we did not have cell phones how would we talk to them so I think we should have computer's. The next reason is what if we has to do a school project and we needed a computer wit h internet what could we do have to write it by hand so at some point I think computer are good to work with like if we needed to find out how to get some place we would need a computer or a gips either one. In conclusion so I think we need computers to do fun stuaff to help us if we needed to find out how to get somewear or do something fun like play games go on @CAPS1 and all that kninda stuff. That's why I think we need computer's the end.,6
141,"Dear Local Newspaper, I think the idea to let people use computers is a good idea. This is because @CAPS1 can help with any school subjects, @CAPS1 can keep you keep in touch with family and friends, and you can even look up and places/destinations. Therefore, I think the effects computers have on people are good. The first reason why I think computers are great for people is because @CAPS1 can help both adults, teenagers and kids with school/education. Computers have a good effect on teenagers because if there was any reason why a teenager wouldn't be allowed to attend college classes they would have another opportunity to take them online. The compuetr helpd adults with college also, if they were to go deal wtih computers whether they worked in an office, or even from home. The computer can also help teenagers and kids because they, or their parents, would be able to look up their homework, or vene if they missed work in school because they were absnet, they would be able to chech that up. In the end, computers are a good effect on people because @CAPS1 can help them with their schooling and education. Another reason why @CAPS1 hink computers are good effect on people is because they can help friends and family stay in touch. Now-a-days were are social networking sites such as facebook, and @CAPS4 where peole can stay iun touch. If nay person had a family member of friend that lived out o f the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 that person would be close to email them and even video chat wiht them. Otherwise, you can them on facebook and you would be bale to look at pictures of them or even send them messages to keep in touch. Teenagers like to also video and on to keep in touch with each other or even like to I.M each other on @CAPS4. A reason why adults can use the computer is because if they were to use a website the use the computer to stay in touch with that person. Therefore, the computer not only could be used for schooling and education, @CAPS1 can also be used for people to stay in touch with one another. The last reason why I think computer are a good effect on peole is beacuse they would be able to lok up places. People sometimes like to look up places where they will be travelling to; so they can find out more about that place. For example like the people, the economy, the money they use etc. You would also be able to look up pictures of how that play looks whether @CAPS1 looked beautiful and different than any other place you're seen or if @CAPS1 looked casual like any other place. For example when my family and I had gone to the @LOCATION1 over break mu parents would constantly look @CAPS1 up online to find out information and to see what @CAPS1 looked like. However, not only can you use the computer to find out information of a place or pictures, you can also find an address of @CAPS1. Therefore, being able to use the computer can help a person find out any inforamtion about any place. Overall, I think computers have a great efefct on people because @CAPS1 could help them with school or any education, @CAPS1 could help people stay in touch with family and friends, and lstly, peopel would be bale to look any up any information or any kind of place.

142,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1 is spending a lot of time on computers. They don’t spend time doing other things like exercising. Spend time with your family and enjoying life. You should spent less time on the computers and more time with your family because if your on the computer all day your family going to think your at bthe family anymore because you never be around. And you dont want that to happend thats why you should spend a little more less time on the computer and more time with your family. Another reason is if you keep on getting on the computer and play games it could get you stupid you should enjoy your life and do something postive with your self instead of getting on the computer all day. If you do that, that mean you have no life. My last reason is you shoud go to the gym and go exercise instead get on the computer. I said that because is on the computer you could get fat, and you be so into the you dont even wanna cook your In conclusion thats what you should do all said and because sometimes stuff like that could get you dumb.",7
143,@PERSON1 ~~~~@CAPS1: @NUM1 @CAPS2: @NUM2 The computers always have had a good affect on people. This is so because they are able to help people in there time of need with the online doctors you can book youâ€™re appoint. This is so much than getting stuck on hold. Next the computers are a great way to meet people after you talk to them you can get to gather and have a great time with your new best friend. On the other hand there are many people online want to hurt you in more ways than one. Another good reason is computer video games. I love these types of games like all teens do. Also this makes a great way to make friends you can play to gather. This dose take away time out side but you can by inside booking a camping trip also you can book a @DATE1 get way this is perfect to get out of work or just call in sick and off you go. I hope this has helped you see that there are manly good things from a computer.,6
144,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In my opinion, the rise of computers effect on teens, adults and children is good. For adults, having a computer is useful for work, and communication. For teens, it is useful for schoolworks, communication and fun. For young children it is useful for fun and learning. I remember when I was younger I of educational games on my computer. I especially enjoyed with, and now for the seven years I have been taking with classes a grade above. This shows the effect a computer could have on a childs education. Also, for teens, having a computer could help them research something for a report. With this research, their project would valid. Also, if somebody forgot what their homeworks was the could ask their friend via @CAPS1 or @CAPS2. This is why computers help with schoolwork. This ties into my next reason, communication. If I forgot my homework I could easily just and a friend to email it to me or past it on @CAPS1. Without computers, there would be no way to get lost of forgotten homework. Also, a computer is a good way to communicate with friends. ""@CAPS3 to my friends @CAPS1 sometimes I'll end up hanging and with that person says local @PERSON1. A recent poll found that @PERCENT1 of all middle school students have a computer with service in their house. Students would benefit from having computers. Friends would benefit also and so would adults. This is another reason why people should use computers. Don't you think that after a long day of school, just want to relax and. Well, for fun computer a play video games. such as and people to play. Over @NUM1 on the internet, and kids would like to play than @NUM2 students said that they play games on the internet and enjoy it. Also fantasy baseball and basketball etc. are great ways for people to learn to manage a learn about players, and have fun. Without the use of computers, following a sports than would be very difficult. This is one last reason why having a computer is a good thing. In conclusion, computer are good because of the educational value, communication, and fun. What do you think? Do you want to take away all these opportunities from people or all ages? If not, we a computer.",8
145,"Imagine a world without computers. What would it be like? For one thing, taking attendance in schools would be much harder than it is right now. It would be much harder and less efficient to take attendance on paper and there would be a much greater likelihood for error. Computers pros out weigh their cons by a long shot, because they simplify everything an make it much more user friendly, they drive almost every man-made thing in the world, and they will reduce the amount of paper we as humans use to make books and other materials. What would having to spend hours looking through dozens of books just to find one little peice of information feel like? Certainly not many kids in todays world would know, given that over @NUM1 of the worlds books are already digitized and you can access them all with just a little click on a keyboard. Most teachers and school administrators do not seem to understand that a little thing called wikepedia is a lot more efficient less time-consuming and a lot less tedious than looking through books. Computers are a great source of information for getting what you want when you want it. You can even search the simplest things, such as the temperature and the humidity. Businesses use microsoft, xcel to graph data, and most of our money is not in dollar bills it is in cyberspace, not even real. As you can see computers really can simplify and make everything a whole easier. My second reason that computers can have and do have a positive effect. On people is because virtually every man-made thing today has a computers of same sort in the cars have computers that automatically call @NUM2 if you get into an accident. Some newer guns, such as the cornershot have computers on them. Even @NUM3 childrens toys that you buy on the streets have computers. Imagine what would happen to @LOCATION1 if its grid network failed. Because all of its traffic lights sewer systems and especially the stock worksheet all run on computers, or in some cases one single computers if they failed their would be mass hysterio. Some people would lose everything they had, and everyone taking the metro or subway would be trapped where they were. Life would be hell without computers. Third, computers reduce the amount of paper used to make books and other materials. Schools alone waste over half of the @LOCATION2's paper supply so the tree hugging should be jabbling at the schools instead of major corporations. Most of todays books and other forms of literature are already digitized.",10
146,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1 of @LOCATION1 town times, @CAPS2 the computer can be very beneficial to the people of our town. It helps us to communicate with one another. From what I understand some experts from the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 The Society say that people are not going outside to exercise and are becoming obesie. I understand that this can be a problem but htere are many other reasons why @CAPS2 the computer is a benefit for everyone such as, researching for many projects and work related things, having the ability to comunicate with friends, and the fact that we can learn about so many subjects as the tips of out fingers. Furthermore let me tell you more about why computers are so useful. In a recent study at @ORGANIZATION1 done by the Computers of the @ORGANIZATION2. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 freshman through sophmore students and if they did not have computer, most of their projects for @ORGANIZATION1 would not @CAPS4 as good of a grade as they did. But of all of these students @PERCENT1 of them used @ORGANIZATION3 search engine to @CAPS4 their info. For example, @PERSON1 was asigned a project that called for her to use her computer and nothing else. On that project she recieved an A+ because she knew where to last for what she maded to find. Clearly almost all students know how to @CAPS4 good, factual info and explain it in their work. To say they dont go outside enough might be true but how else would they @CAPS4 a good grade. In addiction to what I have just explained to you I would now like to talk about second networking, @CAPS5. @PERSON2 recently talked on his show about how networking such as @CAPS6 @CAPS7 an @CAPS8 have made teen lives totally different. "" They can know become closer to friends just by the click of a mouse"", says @PERSON2. Not only is he right but, if teens were not on tthe computer as much, they might not have as many friends. Also, moms and dads are mostly working and are not. able to drive their kids to their friends house as these networking sites are how kids most communicating. Futhermore, In a recent statistic state by the international @CAPS9 @CAPS10, @PERCENT2 of all teenagers found out the news from the internet. From my own personal experiences I found out about the earthquakes in @LOCATION2 by looking at recent photographs taken. Now I that kids should take more time out of their shcedules to go outside and play with friends but going on the computer is a way of us relaying and to catch up with what is happening in our society. If we had nowhere to relax then we would probably have to watch alot more of the news and we all know working television does not help you in the long run. From the facts stasted above, surely going on the computer is resourseful and could be used often because it help kids @CAPS4 excellent grades on, projects having the ability to use social networks, and the will catch you up with the news I know that computers and one of the use resources and know you do too.",10
147,"It has been said that people are the computer alot nowadays, but who said that was a bad thing? It's a great way to stay connected with anywhere. It also teaches a lot and about anything. Finally all the skills you get from a computer can help you get into a good school or get a good job. So hopefully you will see how this can be a good thing. Having a computer is a great way to talk to people without jackin up the phone bill. You can talk to your friends or family no matter where they are even in a forign country. You can email them or even talk to them on a chat so like they're fight there. You can even video video chat is a great even for doing a business or having a family get together. Thats one why using the computer is not a bad thing. You can learn anything you need to know on the computer. You how to speak a different language and learn about their countrys. Instead of your time looking information about something you can for it. Many people think that a good education you have to go college. is not always the. in the future. So as you have read the internet can people successfull in life. Now I hope you see how people using the computer more can actually benefit them. It's a great communication device, teaches people a lot and can help people get into good colleges and get good jobs.",8
148,"Dear @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 times, @CAPS3 @CAPS4! As these words flash across your television you go straight to your @ORGANIZATION1 to find the scoop. About what just happened. While your finding information you tap away @CAPS5 the keys like there's no tommorrow. And before you know @CAPS5 you've finished your article for tommorrows newspaper. Without computers you would only have the manimal details @ORGANIZATION1 the stories about countries half way found the world. To begin, if computers were not helpful and important would schools teach children how to use and create projects with them? According to @PERSON1 @ORGANIZATION1 the @ORGANIZATION1 technology, ""Computers are important to our youth and not only do they enjoy using them, but @NUM1 out @ORGANIZATION1 @NUM2 young adults study more efficiently while using a @ORGANIZATION1."" @CAPS5 school we use computers for everything I can't tell you how many papers I have typed on the @ORGANIZATION1 in my @NUM1 years @ORGANIZATION1 schooling I know that computers help dozens @ORGANIZATION1 kids study too. The social studies book that my class uses has an online textbook with many study tools and resources to use and I score @CAPS5 least @NUM4 points better on tests and quizzes when I use those resources. Which brings me to my next point, computers are fun to use to chat with friends. Social networking sites like @CAPS6, @CAPS7 and @CAPS8 messaging are helpful when contacting friends about homework, meeting up or even having just a friendly conversation. Experts who say ""People are spending to much time on their computers and less time interacting with family and friends"" are contradicting themselves beacuse people every where interact online with their long distance family and friends whether would have no way @ORGANIZATION1 contacting otherwise and make plans with their other family and friends. Finally, in fifth and sixth grade the students in my district had to take a @ORGANIZATION1 class that taught hand-eye coordination and fast reacting time which can be helpful outside @ORGANIZATION1 school and in sports, computers teach and can even sometimes teach better than teachers can. My cousin takes online courses for school so without computers she would not be learning as much. Computers are important to society in this day and age whether that be getting info on world @CAPS4, contacting friends and family or learning new and important subjects.",10
149,"Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that computers do have a positive effect on people. I believe this because of @NUM1 reasons. One, kids can use the computer to do homework. Two, adults and kids can use the computer to view news and what's going on. Lastly, it gives people the ability to talk with others through the web. These are my @NUM1 reasons why I think computers have a positive effect ohn people. Reason one why I think computers have a positive effect on people is because it gives kids the ability to do their homework faster and with more acurate information. According to ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2"" more than @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 rush through their homework and just write down random answers. If a computer was avalible not only will they be getting it done in the same time but the answers would be correct and they would be learning. All because of these being a computer handy kids can now do good in school and still enjoy the outside and other activities they love doing. This is one reason why I think computers have a positive effect on people. Reason two why I think computers have a positive effect on people is because it gives them the access to view the news and what is going on in their area. Some people end up late to work because they didn't know that there was a wreck on the road and it took a while to take care of. I'm pretty sure their boss wasn't to happy when he or she came in late. But if a computer was handy the person could of looked online and saw that and could of found an alternate route to get to work. This is another reason why I think computers have a positive effect on people. My last reason why I think computers have a positie effect on people is because it gives people access to chat with people online. Now a days they have college online which is a good idea. Without a computer people can't use or even look into oppertunities like that. In ""@CAPS3 @CAPS2"" it states that @PERCENT2 of people don't attend college. With a computer people can go to college right from their house. This is my last reason why I think computers have a positive effect on people. By reading this essay I hope that I have persuded you that computers have a positive effect on people for three reasons. It allows kids to do homework, give people access to news, and allows online chatting. I hope you take my letter into consideration of how computers do have a positive effect on people. Thank you.",9
150,"Dear @CAPS1, Computers comsume many hours of what could have been productive time everyday. Although the internet is a great way to stay updated witj current events, it is also very dangerous. Computers lead to cyber bullying weight gain and drapped gradesi which is why I feel they have a negative effect on citizens around the world. As you know teens across @LOCATION1 spend countless hours instant messaging, going on @CAPS8 or @CAPS2, and uploading pictures that anyone can see. However, a good praction of the teen experience the torture of cyber bullying. Children are very much emotional we are still trying to understand the world. With new pressure, the bst thing we need is more drama. However, Computers lead to @CAPS10. This is where a victim is teased or harrassed by someone online. Sometimes, you @MONTH1 not know who this person is. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of the teenagers who were cyberbullied are depressed or commit suicide. It is hard enough to be a teen, bit computers just add more stress; and somtimes ends lives. Obesity is a growing problem in @LOCATION1. Adding on the distraction of television, @CAPS3 everywhere are losing excersize. I have realized that ever since I received my own laptop, I have spent less time excersizing and more time eating. Not only are computers time sonsuming but also lead to drama. as more drame occurs usually eat more. Computers have a large effect on weight gain mostly because of the @CAPS4 for fastfood restaurants. Everywhere you look you could find flashing ads about @ORGANIZATION1 or @CAPS5 @CAPS6. This os encouraing unhealthy eating all around our country but the world. Computers effect the everyday health of humans. Ever wonder why your child is failing school? It could be because they spend too much time on the computer. Internet serves as a distraction all over the world erasing the thought of having to do homework. The more time teens spend on the computers they grow tired and forget about their nightly assignment. Not completing homework for a certain amount of time could lead to dropped grades. Not only does internet effect dropped grades but online games do too! websites suck as addictinggames.com are time consuming. They talk away time that could have been spent doing homework. Also, with the drama that takes place on @CAPS7 or @CAPS8 @CAPS3 might not be able to concentrate on school work out at all. Computers serve as distractions that lead to low grades. I hope you have come to find the dramatic effects computers have on humans. In one day @CAPS9 lose countless hours of precious time just because of a machine. Computers lead to @CAPS10 weightgain, and dropped grades. No wonder @CAPS9 are so stressed! Therefore, I believe computers have a negative effect on people around the world.

Computers are a way to find information about thousands of topics. Have you ever wanted to travel to @LOCATION1? If you jut typed in @LOCATION1' into the search box, millions of websites would pop up in a matter of seconds. If you need directions to the nearest pizza restaraunt, you can just look it up and you will find it. Finally if you need to find a definition to a word in your novel, you can go on to the online dictionary and figure out what it means. @CAPS1, are you now seeing how computers are a great way to find useful information about a variety of topics? Well, computers alos allow us to be very entertained too! Computers allow people to pretty much do whatever they want. They have all sorts of websites that are very entertaining. On computers, you can play hundreds of really fun games. You can choose your ability, level, and @CAPS4 even your character. You can play against people @CAPS4 and it is very fun. Computers can also allow you to read articles about whatever you are interested in. You can read about the local news in your area, and even log on to your local newspapers website and read the breaking news. Oops, I missed my favorite show that was on @TIME1. Don't worry, you can watch it online. @CAPS1, are you now seeing how entertaining computers are? Computers also allow you to chat with your friends too. Computers are a way to stay in touch with your friends whom you @MONTH1 not see everyday. You can just send them an email, and then they can reply right back to you. Also by using @CAPS2, @CAPS3 and other websites you can talk to friends and @CAPS4 you can even do a video chat, where your friend and you are both sitting at the computer and actually physically talking to each other. @CAPS1, are you now seeing how you can talk to your friends and really enjoy yourselves by using a computer? Technology is something that is really a great thing today. It helps us to research things that we care about and give us answers with one click. It also helps us to do things such as watch videos, read articles, and play games. We can even talk to friends. @CAPS1, computers are a great tool that are really good for people to use and own!",9
152,"Dear @CAPS1 team @NUM1, I saw your ad in the paper and thought i would share my opinions. I believe most people enjoys those family more than a computer, but that doesn't mean they can't go on the computer. If you space time used when the computer instead of long period of time then those concerns would go down. Out of @NUM2 people asked @PERCENT1 have used a computer and still talk when family and get outdoor. Though there is many concerns, they are benefits and using both to keep more managable life. many experts worry because some people are on the computer for hours at a time. This is a concern but I'm sure these people still got out side and exercise. However, not everyone. so if you are sitting on the compuer for hours then you at a higher risk of getting over weight, and not getting to explore nature, Everyone need to get at least @NUM3 minutes of exercise of at least outide activitys such us baseball, football, soccer, tenis and swimming. If sports aren't your favorite then you can hangout with some friends and family. Computers are a great thing but to much can be a very regretful experience. Although computers can have a negitive effect on people, they are extremely helpful to todays society. If kids are having trouble in school they can be tutored online or can talk to someone help. Also, in todays working society computers are used, so knowing how to use are and having hand and eye coordination is a wonderful quality. People that like to travel can map out a trip and pre order items like maps, hotels, plane tickets, and emails that will be happening where they go. If you don't know how to use a computer you @MONTH1 be out jobs. I believe that more people schools use computer for short periods of time and still have time to exercise. This idea @MONTH1 be a better way to keep people more healthy and keep their knowledge to a modern day level. Many benefits and concerns could be brought to agreement. Using free time to use the computer and learn about subjects in school and outside interact like skatebording and guitar or even dancing. So many different people can be interested in computers but you have to make sure that your getting proper exercise and spending time with family and friends. Overall I thinkg people that can not seem to got off computers need a job similar to what they like on computers. For example, if you like racing cars, then you can be a technical engineer. If you like to cook then you can take classes online if your busy a lot. So using both benefits and the concerns you can move life a better for you and others. Weather its too much computers and not enough time outside, with proper time use with computer runy people will be fit and have a better knowledge. Getting peoples ideas and thought can make a society more functional and more knowying about computers and these effects on people.",10
153,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I believe that computers are bad in many ways, even though they have advantages. I believe that @LOCATION1 depends on computers too much. For example, what if @CAPS4-@CAPS5 decides to @ORGANIZATION1 the @CAPS1 coast? Entire buissnesses would be lost. Almost every family's savings would also be lost. There would be chaos everywhere. Another thing that happens is that computers fill in job opprutunities so that now the economy is affected. People won't make enough money to buy the things that the computers make. Another crazy thing about computers is that people who use them dont get enough exercise. I mean isn't @LOCATION1 fat enough already? We should all be getting outside for at least @NUM1 hours per day. So whether its exercise terrorists, or just a bad economy, Computers are ruining the world that we now know and love.",6
154,"Dear newspaper, I think computers are a positive influense on society. Because the noleg it gives us and the many uses it has for our country and socity today in our generation of tecnology. Haveing computers benefits us in so many way's like helpin us find information on a school project. Also to comunicate with others and have fun on sum of the game sites that provide varius things that we need or want. If you were to do a sorve of how many people have a computer or use one I think you would get @PERCENT1 of our population. Even if it does cause problems with berth I dont think people could go on with there jobs schooling and stuff like taxes when time comes. Last but not least people say that when you use the coputer your not relly doing anything but I beg to difer because when your on the coumputer you always pick up something you didn't know that important. I learning is exercise what is it takes more energy to learn then to run or walk or play outside for an hour a least there not watching cartoons or some outher redicules show insted there learning not roting there brain watching @CAPS1. So in counclusion I think computers are the best thing that was ever invented because all of what you can do on them the cool information that you can find this is why I think that it benefits socity in so many ways.",8
155,"Dear, local newspaper place I belive that computer change a lot of things in peoples life. Like the way people do in school, there health and teanagers scoicrel lifes. Computers can help people in school with information for. Homework and find they need. So kids wouldn't have any reason not to have there homework done. On the ohter hand it could be bad with all the new things but today like phone kids can cheat on tests if they wanted to. Computers can also be bad for your health. People tend to get lazy and want to stay on computers to long and play world of warcraft this is same what of a bad because your foced to eat when your in. Then you don't have time to make real food so you eat hotpockets and. Sometimes people stay up much to late to late play games or looking up things on youtube.

156,"Dear the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am writing to you about the latest topic has going around. is if computers benifit our society. I will tell you about the good and bad opinions about spending time on the computer and how it help us in our everyday lives. Some of the good things that computers bring to our society is learning. Even adults learn new stuff on computers. You can go on websites and learn new things like a new language, if you never graduated out a diploma. go to college and many others. Some people think that a computer is just can look up online. But it's not only good for that. There is social networks like twitter, facebook and myspace. You can have to friends @NUM1. Also people can connect with their work or schools. Now there always has to be a bad side to everything. Some of the bad things to people on all. Instead that could be out with friends or family, enjoying a walk, and out. And once you get online and become part of something you get addicted for being on the internet all. Another thing we can be for computers are machines. Machines can be used for everything. If its for entertainment, programing, building or surgery. Now almost every hospital is using some kind of machine in over, at @MONTH1. In most our companys it is not people building the cars. It is people controling the machines that build car. In any kind of house/ building / warehouse you will have I machine. Or at least I. As you can see in this letter that we can't live without computers in our everyday lives. We have are around us time. We will always wander why computers weren't softly enough.",8
157,"Dear Local Newspaper: @CAPS1 without computers is just a waste of time. Computers were designed to ease the work of some bothersome activities. Computers are positive because it is simple to write essays with, there are many educational aspects to them and there is always new and developing technology to learn about. In @ORGANIZATION1, essays will always be assigned. Computers greatly help with this because students don't have to write everything by hand. The computer makes the writing easy to read and edit. It makes a long job very quick and easy. Spell check features teach proper spelling and grammar usage by showing if corrections are needed. This leads to an overall higher quality essay that is easy to correct, all from a computer. However, that's not the only way computers help in @ORGANIZATION1. On any computer, there are ways to extend your education even further than @ORGANIZATION1. There are many @CAPS2 and sites that provide lessons that relate to @ORGANIZATION1. @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION1 says, ""A computer is a great way to extend childrens knowledge on a topic. Most are simple to use, and they're fun!"" @CAPS2 keep kids interested while they develop more learning skills for the future. This electronically powered machine is great for education. With programs improving, there is always new things to do. Computers are constantly changing and becoming more advanced, providing things to do. @NUM1 computer owners say that the latest developments for computers give them useful tools for daily activities. They also provide people with jobs ranging from repairs to programming. Calendars promote organization and punctual timing. Computerized calculators provide quick access whenever the time should come. Even for a newspaper company like yours can benefit from this technology with virtual newspapers along with normal newspapers. In conclusion, computers are good for everyone because they are constantly developing, they help with essays and assignments, and there are many ways to extend your educational knowledge. After reading this essay I know that you will agree with me. ",10
158,"I think that computers are the mores important things to use because they are more thing that you can do on computer. One day I was on the computer write a essay because it had to be typed. So I was in the microsoft word to typed my essay it was better then the notepad. In microsoft word there is a lot more to use for essays. The second reason why computers are better because you can go on the internet to play games, find animals, pictures, etc. The reason why I like computer is because I love to play game on andkon, miniclip, or kings. That is why computers are better then everything esle. The thired reason why I'm writing this is because to help other people to understand why computer are better. People should know that computer are better then phones ipods etc. That why people should started using computer in there house. In conclusion, computer are better then phones. I love to have a computer to learn more in life about other thing that I don't know yet.",6
159,"Dear to who it @MONTH1 @CAPS1, A computer has become a way of life these days. Almost every household has a desktop computer and many individuals own laptops. Though everyone depends on a computers they are a waste of time. They @MONTH1 help people communicate and find information, but they are useless otherwise. Computers are a waste of time because they are full of useless websites that do not benefit anyone, they spread rumors and gossip that are completely irrelivent, and they distract people from their real lives. Computers are time wasters aside from a few things like research and email. First, computers are the machines in which someone @MONTH1 use to access the internet. Some will use the internet for business, or work. But most people will use the internet for useless sites like twitter, facebook, @CAPS2, or youtube. Though many will argue this statement those sites are completely irrelivant to a perons outside life and do nothing but waste peoples time on things that won't really make a difference in their life, unlike work. Second, so much pointless gossip has been spread throughtout the internet. Mostly these rumors pertain to pop-culture. Media rumors about celebrities are passed around and become the center of attention. These rumors an gossip do not benefit anyone. You @MONTH1 now know an embrassing fact about a celebrity but does not effect their future. Most rumors are forgotten within months which simply goes to show that it doesn't really matter or have a big effect on anyone in the end. Lastly, the internet can become a huge distraction to nes life. Different rumors, websites, and online games can steal ones attention to their life away. They start to focus on worthless media and don't realize whats important. People are tricked into thinking something like posting on facebook is important and must be part of their daily routine when it really is distracting them from what is important and what should been done daily. Computers, and internet especially, can take hours out of important things people could be doing in life. In conclusion, computers and the internet are a waste of time. Aside from work purposes, computers are a distraction to daily life. Computers offer pointless websites that take up time, spread pointless rumors and gossip, and overall distract people from their lives. Computers should not be banned or anything of the sort, but should simply be used for what is important.",10
160,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 since the day it was invented, the computer has been regarded as a piece of technology that can help us. Over the years, companies and people have modified and improved computers to the point that they can fit in the palm of your hand. We rely on the computers and in return, they do our work efficiently. However, some people are concerned that computers could be bad for us. I'm not one of those people. After all, is there anything wrong with increasing hand-eye coordination, learn about whatever you want, and talk to anyone online all at the single click of your mouse? I used to get ot a @DATE1 camp, where I boarded at a college and took courses for three weeks. In this time, I met plenty of friends. As you can probably tell, by the end of the three weeks, I had to say goodbye-but not before collecting all of their @CAPS3 adresses! @CAPS2 friends came from all over the world. For example, @CAPS2 roommate came from @LOCATION1, and @CAPS2 classmate came all the way from @LOCATION2! Computers, in this case, became @CAPS2 means of communication. I could send all @CAPS2 friends an @CAPS3, and they would recieve it in less than a minute ( much faster, compared to ""snail mail"" which took a few days to receive. @CAPS2 computer allowed me to stay in touch with all of @CAPS2 friends, with-out the costly phone bills, or slow delivery time, @CAPS3 helps almost everybody-from the business people discussing urgent matters, all the way down to people like me, who are just trying to talk to their friends. However, emailing isn't the only good thing about computers! Have you @CAPS1 been assigned a school project on something rediculous that you don't know, like the element of @ORGANIZATION2, or how to build an engine? No matter what topic you're assigned, the internet will have an answer, or at least a theory. A big advantage of having a computer is the fact that there are expansive search engines, such as google or yahoo. Because the internet is unlimited, you can find your answer online, whether it's from the online scientific dictionary, or a nobel prize winner's bestselling book-which is very convenient. By doing so, you literally have access to all of the knowledge in the world. @PERCENT1 of people who use their computer have better hand-eye coordination than those who don't use a computer, according to a recent research experiment. Hand-eye coordination is an @CAPS4 part of our lives. Without it, we wouldn't be able to pick up something, or do most functions with our hand! From these statistics, it's clear that there's a strong positive correlation between using the computer and hand-eye coordination. After all, how else would @PERCENT1 @PERCENT1 of computer users have better hand-eye coordination than people who don't use computers. Because hand-eye coordination is such an important part of our daily routines, I'd say that it's safe to assume that computers benefit society, as well as ourselves. As you can probably tell, computers have improved our world in so many ways. With the invention of super-fast processing computers, we're able to do things even quicker than before. From gathering information, to improving hand-eye coordination, then to communication, I think that we should be able to agree that computers, @CAPS5 not @CAPS4 to the physical needs of the human race, are a wonderful invention that should be cherished, seeing as they greatly help and benefit our society, even up to today! *- @CAPS5 books @MONTH1 hold the same information, it's much easier to find it online rather than skim through a myriad of pages to get your answer.",11
161,"To @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I have recently heard about the use of computers and how they dont benefit society. I think that is wrong, computer benefit our society in many ways. Computer teach us hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places. Most importantly allows people to talk online with people all over the world. First, computers have always benefited our society by teaching us hand eye coordination. Hand-eye coordination helps everyone, people of all ages and for different reasons. It helps us better in sports such as a basketball, football, soccer and all other sports. We have perfected our aim and how to use it to benefit other things. Like if someone through a saccer ball at you, you would have hand-eye coordination and will be able to hit him or her back, im not saying you should do that but the computer has showed you hand-eye coordination. Also, computers have also helped us learn about far away places. Children all over the country have used a computer to help them learn about far away places for project and homework. Even adults as well have used the computer to search about far away places they want to go to. For example my parents have recently researched a place they want to go to for their anniversary, they planned on going to @LOCATION2. Anyways, all im saying is that all kinds of people use the computer to search or learn about far away places. Lastly, we all have used computers to talk to someone. Even if it was your grandmother, we all have done it, for different reasons to. If you didn't get the social studies homework go online and asle a friend, or even a teacher. Sometimes you just want to talk to someone but dont have their number, go online and see if their on. Not long ago I used the computer for this reason, I went online to see if I could find my great grandmother, and I did. I talk to her for hours, she lives in @LOCATION1 and is @NUM1 years old. But understand that any person and every person talks to someone online. In conclusion, the use of computers has benefited us and our society. It has taught us hand-eye coordination, gave us the ability to learn about far away places and also gives us the chance to talk to people online. I think the people who disagree should change their mind about that. Havent you used a computer, doesn't it help your life a lot?",9
162,"Dear cheshire newspaper, @CAPS1 a poll of @NUM1 residents, of all ages, in the town of cheshire, @PERCENT3 said that computer overall benefit our society, more and more people are turning to computers now-a-days. But, not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I believe that computers do benefit society because they teach hand-eye cordination, you can talk to people from faraway places and you can learn new things from them. Firstly, computer involve using the mouse, keybourd and the screen. As an infant, all actions of your eyes on the screen, while you hands on the mouse or keyboard, need to work together in order to complete a simple task of clicking on a website. Due to recent study. @PERCENT4 of the function in your (eye function) and your (hand function) goes directly into the process of making things about. Just using the mouse and screen is great practice, and youth children. Mary @CAPS2 a mother from chesshire, says ""@CAPS3, I didn't allow my @NUM2 year old son the computer because i didn't want him to form any bad habbits. But, he was having trouble with his coordination. so i gave him some educational games in play on the computer for @NUM3 minuts per day and i can already see an improvement."" @CAPS4. Nemur from @ORGANIZATION3 university also that computers are a great way to teach tings that you can't find in a textbook. Do you want your child to talk. very simple quality to ? as you can see computers are great for society because they teach hand-eye coordination. Secondly, computers give you the ability to talk to people from faraway places. My sister @CAPS5 goes to college, and i don't get to see her, every week we and just chat. I would miss @CAPS5 more than i already do if i didn't have a computer, this is the lifestle of many men and women in way, who miss their family. @PERSON1 who lieves with her kids @CAPS6 and @PERSON2 exclaims, "" my husband has been stationed in @LOCATION1 for one years and and the only time I get to talk to him is on the computer. ""@CAPS7 the of three with family members in the war, imagin get a foll report from loved ones. In essense computer can bring a family together. Lastly You can learn new things from computer. A recent study from @ORGANIZATION2 shows that @PERCENT1 of students use the internet for information on projects, reports @PERCENT2 say that computer won't benefit the society? Most of the information today is not found in book. study from the university of shows that only @PERCENT5 of the information you gather is from reading. a bunch of people would call this unfortunate, but the kids those days are much smarter then kids in the @DATE1's. In addition mostly all buinesses are computer data and importan information. @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1, all of our textbooks, assignments, and grades are now. The access i have helps me a ton overall computer have much information for our everyday lives. In conclusion, kids learn social techniques such as hand-eye cordination, computers allow you to get much with people around the world, and computers store many things. Which you use daily, You @MONTH1 say that computers do not benefit everyday living, but from the already presented I believe they do. computers are useful, reliable and easy to access, which make them a significant part of the human lifestyle. thank you for you time.",10
163,"Computers who need them, Some say there just as bad as tv and I agree for multiple reason's first, your playing game that can be addictive and you cant sleep or eat. Nextly, @CAPS1 time website @MONTH1 have inaproperate lounge or pictures. Last but definatly not least lack of exercise and you can gain plenty of punds. Still think computers strenghen hand eye coordination and give people a chance to learn about far away place so can @CAPS2 and textbooks still dont think computers or bad let me elaberate. First thing first addictive game have a very large effect sometime when your booked on the game you would say ""wait please after I beat this level"" or ""I'll eat after I beat this game on the computer"", @CAPS3 not good to stay on the computer all the time and play play video games the whole time. Then there is impropreite websites with inapropriente langue and peictures a child @MONTH1 stumble on and I hardly dought you @MONTH1 want your kid using inapropriate! Saying and word's into very disgusting and inapropriate pictures while look for a website. Lastly on of biggest reason is the look of exercise that bad you can be wasting your time inside when you can go outside and exercise of interact with friend and family there is so much thing you can do instead of staying inside and you can loose the weight you gain while playing on the computer. In conclusion here what you can do you can go outside enjoy the fresh air and hang out with friends and family I'm not saying @CAPS3 is all bad you must limit the time to a minnimum there is ton's you can do so just do @CAPS3 @CAPS3 can be a good thing.",9
164,"Dear, @ORGANIZATION1 do have on effect on people, because most people now go on the computer for everthing. A computer is a place where you can chat with your friends, And. just be online all the time without interact with people around you, @CAPS1 I think at this point most teens like to just sit on the computer all day and not have to worry about getting fresh are talking to others gany outside to enjoy the weather most and people just like staying on the computer all day and not worring about there family, And other friends. @CAPS1' to me I really think that computers do have affect not of peoples lives to make than just sit there and stay on the computer all day and chat but most people like gany on the computer because you can sit there and talk all day and not do nothing and not with people you. Most dont know this but it is not really good to have that affect on you because every time you would like to do something you want to leave away from the computer @CAPS1 to have that effect on you about your computer is not really good for you. Its a good thing that you can go online and talk to people but not on the line because people got that effect that makes than want to be on the computer all day. Than your body is not getting a lot of excersis and then that mess up your weight class than you start to become lazy and never want to do any thing, And not go places, @CAPS2 than you wouldnt be fit right and you would a person who lazy and who just work to sit home all the time and be on the computer. @CAPS1 most people who are on the computer most of the time. Should take some time out of being on the computer and give more time to excercising and staying fit and get out the house and enjoy and stop someting most time on the computer @CAPS1 the of this I hope I you and I hope you agree with me about people staying on the computer most of the time and not boring with things than besides on the computer.",8
165,"Dear Newspaper, Have you ever wanted to learn about something but your knowledge is limited due to you only have books around you, well not with a computer. On a computer you can search anything you want to learn about in the world, communicate through a webcam with somebody thats on another continent, and a computer can be used for movies games and software. When i need to do a big school project i usally use a book a little bit, then i look for legit knowledge on the internet. I find that the possobilites are endless for reaserch on the internet also can be used for pictures or historical artifacts that you would want placed onto your project, or for you to just see a detailed picture on them. I also heard that @PERCENT1 of scientist have information that is of the internet. When my friend moved very far away we would still be able to see each other because we both had a webcam on our computer, so he was @NUM1 states away but i was able to still see him in a video chat. To me thats an amazing step in technology, I amseeing that is being used more frequently for science, lessons in school and etc. Society is defintitly benifiting off of computers. Whenever i get bored i like to hap on my computer and play a game, or watch movies or tv on the computer. There is also other things to do like use videographic softwares or use picture editing softwares. By doing this using a computer has changed my life insort of a way it helped me pick out a curver choice by starting to work in videographics.

166,"Dear Local newspaper, I think computers are not making people lose exercise because you get exercise with every letter or word that you type and it is a great way to interacte with family, friends, and a way to meet new people. You can also watch and create you own interesting videos or maybe to get a job because you might be unemployed and need money to pay bills or you want to get car insurance. Their are so many things you can get online that you can't buy at stores. Like real wooden finger boards or tech of of flat face, cum or prowood, You can buy off of any finger board site you wanna buy off of it's fun and easy. If you miss something on the news you can go to and get news in you town when you want it a how you want it. You can use facebook or myspace to interact with you friends and family. You can book vacations or get aways online it any vacation website/hotel websites. You can find your unclaimed money at unclaimedmoneycity.com of money on I have fifty bucks on my how much do you have to find out are click away.

You can take a with you when you away on a trip or go for a ride in your you can use a laptop basically anywhere you want even in bed or walking just don't drop it if you drop it you might break it then you would to buy a new one which cost a lot of money if you a laptop have money you can enter on you computer to win a laptop or any other thing you heard desires like an ipod touch or you own xbox maybe you can win free games such as skate @NUM1 or call of duty.",8
167,"I think that computers are ok because they can be useful at times when it comes to research, location and chat. They can't be useful all the time because they there are pop-ups, and viriuses. Im not saying computers is a good thing or bad thing, it's just ok at sometimes. I think computers are ok because they use very useful. For example @PERSON2 need help finding his friends house but his mom told him to go on google earth or mapquest that helped him alot. Computers are pretty handy especially research but not that much websites are good and that's why you have to find specific information. Without computers, how can people talk to their friends from a far away distance like @LOCATION3 or @LOCATION2 and @CAPS1 or phones were built because of computers when it comes to chatting, emails, and now for game systems also. My @NUM1 reason why computers are @CAPS2.K. because they tick people off sometimes because they would crash or have pop-ups + viruses. For instance, @DATE1. @PERSON1 has to go to her friends but when she hut down her computer a big internet explores sign was her career and it took @PERCENT1 minutes to chat down so she had to get her hardrive fired. And staying on the computer, is not good either you have to take a break so it can @CAPS5 your bill problems or just hang out with your friends because communication is of teamwork and community. My last reason why I think computers are oil because of the @CAPS6 of @ORGANIZATION1 problems with computers and paper work. ""I am glad there was one man and all he did was create @ORGANIZATION1 which was the best selling computers in the country. I am also glad of his work when the computers stopped and they created @CAPS3 box and @CAPS3 box @NUM2. On the other hand like I said before that computers have problems that cause people to lase it. Tons of damaged computers were shown in @LOCATION1 for a program called ""@CAPS5 the Computers @CAPS6"" which tells people to @CAPS5 power to their computers and to get out of the house and have fun outside no matter where you go. Paperwork was used to sign contracts, assignments and documents. From @NUM3 to college senior years.

Many students will hurt thier palms by writing @NUM4 hours and @DATE2 but thats why we have computers. ",9

But a lot of kids spend most of their days on the computer in sted of going outside and have fun or doing actives like sports. So just for all the parents out their, @CAPS1 is a special thing on a computer. This speciel thing can be found in the settings on your computer it ceeps count of how long your kids are on for. If you put a serten time on it, it will turn your computer off on the time you settel. And you need password to get back on so remember the password you selected. So I think if we tell parents these serten things kids will be more healthy and will still get time to go on their computers. So computers are nether good or bad it just depends on how you use them. So try to use them the right way. Just to talk to friends for a little and to do your home work or just to learn something new everyday. So local newspaper please help get the word out and help all people to get more fit and healthy. Thank you.",7
169,"Dear Local Newspaper, Technology has deffinitly become a part of society @CAPS1 a days everyone's always on their phones, or iPods. Most people have thought that technology is a good thing, but @CAPS2's affecting us because we spend hours on end sitting at the computer. Other think that technology's there for a reason so to use @CAPS2 as much as you want as long as your happy with @CAPS2. I happen to be one of those people that think that too, if I enjoy then I should use @CAPS2. Computers are one of the most common technology known right @CAPS1. I feel that a computer is great because with typing a few words and clicking on some buttons you have the world at your fingertips @CAPS2 makes finding information so much easier, you can find out anything you want, whenever you want without having to go through much difficulty. @CAPS2 doesn't only give you one answer to your question but millions of answers that fit exactly what your looking for. Computers also allow easy comunication, @CAPS3 in the day people would send letters and recieve them in a week, but the internet is international so you can send on e-mail or instant message and recieve @CAPS2 in just a few seconds other people prefer to talk on the phone which is fine too but @CAPS1, as technology is getting more advance you can webchat and see the person as you talk to them, wouldn't that be much better then just hearing and speaking to a relative across the country or a friend in a different country I know I enjoy @CAPS2, almost every week while I webchat with my grandma in @LOCATION1. Computers just get better and better, @CAPS1 a days you can even shop online, for @CAPS4, shoes,accesories anything really @CAPS5't you hate walking around a store for hours, and they @CAPS5't even have your size? I know I do especially with my mom But @CAPS1 you can buy @CAPS4 or anything else you'd like from the comfort of your computer chair and no more waiting in line for hours. Even though people say that computers and technology are bad for society, I disagree and feel that we should be able to use computers as long as we have moderation, because @CAPS2 really is a wonderful thing and we should be thankful for @CAPS2.",9
170,"Dear People of @ORGANIZATION2 many computers do you have in you household? I'll admit myself that we have in mine, one for each person. However, I feel, that this technology has had a negative affect on people, despite its benefits to society is a whole at several personal risks, no matter @ORGANIZATION2 safe they think they are. The time spent staring at a desktop is the time you are take away from your own heath, and possible your lifetime. Yes, there are ways to communicate with person on a computer, but this process seperates people from their families, and teaches kids to live in a typed world, so they don't know @ORGANIZATION2 to act face to face. Then there are those people who use computers or any such technology to harm someone. Why would you give the real world for such chances? I have @NUM1 questions for you. @ORGANIZATION2 much time in one day do you spend on your computer and have you ever noticed the correlation between that amount of time and your pant size? A study done by a group at the @ORGANIZATION1 found that for every hour spent on a computer you gaini another half of a. Crazy, right? But this happens because you aren't execising or even just walking during this time, This also accurs because as you sit, there, your body's healthy doing anything, as it slows down your digestive systems. Another way that affects health is that is almost encourages unhealthy habits smoking. @PERCENT1of people who fail at an attempt to quit smoking spend an average of @NUM2 hours per day on a computer. This because your mind isn't, so i'ts free, to give in to small impulses and desires. We all know such unhealthy habit to bad to and eventually . When you ask your child what they do with their friends, you ever locking for the answer. We t'll a lot? No, because you know that the way someone sounds in a writter, phoned message, isn't always @ORGANIZATION2 they are in real life. If you have difficulting talking to or liking a person when you see them face to face, then your relationship with them isn't real. An all can lie to you or be cruel because the person on the other end forgets you are real. Computers are a way for kids to spend all their time on a false relationship. Two polls were taken by the same @NUM3 people. One asked if you had a good, or bad relationship with your family. The other asked @ORGANIZATION2 many hours you spend on a computer. The majority of @PERCENT2 people said the devote @NUM1 1/@NUM1 hours to their computers but that same majority also said they have bad relationships with their family members. It doesn't take much to understand @ORGANIZATION2 this happens. Not only is the time separating a family, but as a person gets more addicted to their computer they become more wrapped up in their own, non existent world. Being online can be very dangerous, because there are people out there who want to hurt you, or are just plain bothering you. A few years ago, a teenage girl had a friend she completely truisted that she @CAPS1 often. They planned to meet at a mall. The same girl was found dead in that mall. As you maight have gathered, communications online can be dangerous, and very unsafe. Any one can have access to you and some people will contiunue to pester you wheneven you go online.",10
171,"Dear local newspaper, I think that the effects of computers have more of a positive impact rather than a negative one. Computers are great for many reasons and it would be exrenley difficult to do things without these pieces of technology. Computers have positive @CAPS1 because you can chat online with your friends see what is going on in the world, and check email and important events. Chatting online with friends can be a very good thing with thing like chat you can talk to friends plan out things like when you want another about online chatting is facebook on facebook you can also talk to friends but something great about facebook is you can reconnect with old friends that might have moved or gone to a new school. But its not just great for kids. It can be good for adults too! Adults can reconnect with old friends from high school and college and much more. Computers are also great because you can see whats going on in the world. You can do that on @CAPS2.V. to right? that's probably your question but can you check it as quiclky as you went to? or computers. You can. You dont have to watch tall of the news you can just go online and see what is more interesting to you. Checking this on the computer is very important. email updates are this. People can set updates on checks is big too. For example childrens sports are posted online and you can check there. How would you know when you have a sporty, news alot of other events without it? In conclusion I have stated my opinions on why computers have a positive impact. I think we need them u although they are have a. Positive impact because you can chat online, see word news, and check things.",8
172,"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 more and more people use computes but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Owning a computer could be a good thing but becomes an unhealthy habit. I believe people spend too much time on computers. People need to get more exercise go outside with friends and family and enchance your learning. If we could get how people think about computer time, it will be a whole new ball game. To start off with families need to get more exercise. Our country is becoming the ""fattest country in the wourld."" personally I think that is the worst nickname for the @ORGANIZATION1. Don't you think so too? Our country needs to get off @ORGANIZATION1 our couches and get off @ORGANIZATION1 being behind a computer screen all day long. Having a computer only makes you lazier. "" @CAPS2 can you go take out the trash"" ""@CAPS3 on @CAPS4, I just started to talk to them!"" @CAPS5't this sound familier? Scientists show after this scene, most likely @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 our country stastys on the computer for another hour. Our country needs to get more exercise. In addition, we really need to go outside more. We should appreciate the outdoors. Instead @ORGANIZATION1 sitting in front @ORGANIZATION1 the computer, go outside and play a game with friends, family or a neighbor. There are so many healthy activities you can do outside. Just imagine a warn, @DATE1 day, playing wiffle doll in your yard with your neighbor hood. Maybe not to you, but to me that sounds great compared to sitting inside, in front @ORGANIZATION1 a computer screen. You should really think about how much better being in the great outdoors than playing inside on a computer is. Lastly, people really need to enhance their learning. Sure, you can find facts on the internet, but whatever happened to reading a good book. Sitting on a couch, eating potato chips is certainly not better than readin a suspensful book in the nice @DATE1 breeze. You can read anywhere you want! I know I would much rather read a book thatn "" surf the web"" for hours. In conclusion, these machines are becoming too addictive to our society. We need to stop this before computers swallow our world. People need to get more exercise, go outside and enhance their learning the healthy and proper way. Our society needs to step up and explain how much better it is with less time on the computer.",10
173,"Dear @CAPS1, I think that people are spending too much on the computers. I think this because some of my friends now can stay on the computer all day and not go anywhere, also when you stay on the computers you won't be out side and not useing their energy and I read magazines and some stistics say that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 that use computers all the time become oubeast. My first reason why I think people are spending too much time on the computer is, now when I am on the computer people are on all day every day they don't go anywhere they just sit at their computer and just talk to other people. My second reason why I think people spend too much time on the computers is when people are on computers they are not out side when they are on the computer eating a bunch of food they are not out side where they can be exercising and be fit. My third reason why I think people spend to much time on computers is; about a week ago I was reading a magazine and some satistics said that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 that use computers most of their time become oubeast because that's all the time. Now I hope you can see why I think people spend too much time on the computers.",7
174,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 imagining our entire society with no computers. People would be helping the environment and exercising. We would have so many less obese people. Not only that, but hundreds of people have gotten in trouble iver the internet. On facebook and many other sites why would anyone ever want to rsik going to jail? If we don't have computers then these bad thing wouldn't happen, computers are going to always have negative effects an everyone. Today in our economy and environment things aren't doing so well. Forest are being overturend into malls and other shopping centers, oceans polluted by disgusting, black oil. Many people can be worried about it, but wont do anything because the're inside or their computers. They could be helping save the @NUM1 forrests that are being destroyed every year. Insted they decide to go on facebook, myspace, and twiter. If we had more people outdoors working towards a better environment, then I doubt there would be as many issues as there are in the world today. Not only can being outdoors help the environment, if people werent on computers then they would probably be exercising. In the @ORGANIZATION1 @PERCENT1 of the population are obese, This is not right, people shouldn't be sitting on their computers for hours on end. I undestand how this can be hard for some when it come to working on computers for your job. Although isn't your personal health just as importan? Computers can start to get addicting for millions of people so it is important to get over that and do some exercising for a change. Everyone could be so much healthier if they just got off the computer and went for a run. I have heard about so many horrible cases where people have hurt themselves because of what people said to them over the computer. Even though they can have no idea who they're talking to, they would take your own life. This is horrible and has to stop now, people should not be getting hurt over the internet. it is scary to know that there are people out there who would do this. If nobody had computers then lives would be saved and you would have better self esteems. My friend @PERSON1 agrees ""when people are cyber bullying. it takes the fun out of computers and starts to scare me'"" computers are making people and worried. It is obvious that computers have very negative effects all kids and adults. I honeslty believe we should not have computers, without them we could learn to be less obese, and help our world's environment. We would have less incidents of bullying over the internet. Computers have a horrible down-side and end up effecting us all in a worse way than we imagined.",10
175,"Did you know that computers have gotten us to move a head to life. I believe that computers benefit to society. I believe that computers allow us to communicate to one another, it can create @LOCATION1 cures and @LOCATION1 technolgy, and we can learn more about the world and society. First computers are a good way to stay intouch with your friends and family or even got to met someone @LOCATION1. From dateing serveses that matches you up to someone you might want to spend to rest of your life with to face book which is were you can chat with friend and family members now you can even video chat. For example this is a great way to comupate and talk to your friends. I go to camp in main and I live far away from all of my friends so the way that I keep in contact with them, is through the computer. Next, the computer is not just for comunication but it can also help invet @LOCATION1 tecnal things. For example if you wanted to build ky @LOCATION1 you could first build it on the computer and get a full view of what it would look like before building it. I watched this show about @PERSON1 and it was saying how they could build a modle of a bike on the computer and find out every they to know before building it in real not pay a single. Also @PERSON2 from the @ORGANIZATION1 stated ""for and we have done everything on the computer"" @CAPS1, computers can catch you up with the latest storys that happend all around the world in a matter of seconds rather then waiting the next day for the news paper to find out the same information that you did right wen it happend because of the computer. One time my friend was traveling out of the country so she didnt have a @CAPS2.V. but she brought her computer and she could watch the news and she could find out anything she wanted to like weather on her computer. Therefore, the computer can keep you informed in everything that you want to know out you just have to be and be careful what you say. Once again computer can help you gey inform in what is going on around the world. It allows you to communicate to family and friends, and it helps us and move on without technology and find cures to help everyone.",9
176,"The increasing use of computers to some people @MONTH1 seem like a bad thing but it isn't. In my opinion the advancement in technology can help people because it can help us with bussinesses to make less mistakes in the future. Also, computers are used for research on many things from places to medical issue. In the world of bussiness a computer can be very helpful when it comes to taxes. For example, each year you have to find the total amount you spent on taxes. Many people keep track of this by using a grid or calender of the year. A grid or @CAPS1 on a computer wouldn't take as long to fill out or find mistakes. In designing a buiding you have to draw each room and the demensions of the room. A computer and program will help you fit the peices together so that you building, will have all the right angles and spacing. Finally, in a job where you have to communicate with people from all over the world you might need to share information quickly. For example, a company can have more than one location around the world so if it is found that in the @LOCATION1 a product is failing to work they need to contact everyone immediatly. Not only in buissiness is this helpful but in research for people. Starting very young in life @CAPS3 do research on various topics. In school @CAPS3 do research on places, events, animals and more for projects. This year @CAPS3 dd a project on the @CAPS2 and had to do research from online. Nearly all that @CAPS3 learned to complete this project was found online. By completing this project and using the computers @CAPS3 learned about a topic none of us would have chose to. But for projects and learning isn't the only thing that can be found online, @CAPS3 plan vacations and parties all the time. First @CAPS3 learn about the place and then @CAPS3 contact people to be there and how to get there all by comuter. @CAPS3 also use computers for medical research. Scientists use information posted by others to learn how treatment react with people or chemical interactions. By computer you can also learn different tests used to find the problem with people. or how things should look if they work properly. Finally you can research disease and how people are affected by it. For example, in health class @CAPS3 researched lung disease; how it happens and what it does to body. In knowing this i can prevent myself from experiencing it. Computers can benefit society in many ways because the help us in our bussiness life or everyday life. No matter our age. @CAPS3 will need to research many things to learn and grow as people.",9
177,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, A computer is a high tech, knowledge full devise that is like a huge encyclopedia but easier to use and quicker! @CAPS3 is also a scoial network and helps make new friends in the comfort of your home. You can do almost anything on computers now, find out how people live aorund the world or even just webcam with one of your friends. A huge advantage to computers is world wide web (www.) @CAPS3 can take you anywhere from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1. World wide web is like a social highway @CAPS3 cconnects everyone in the world and teaches people how others live. Also with world wide web you can meet anyone through a chat or even a webcam call. Talk about a lot of friends! Some @MONTH1 say the internet is taking away time from family friends and education. I think the complets oppisite! To me the internet is creating so many new opportunitys to reconnect with old friends and make new friends. Also I talk to my friends much more through webcam and chat messaging. When @CAPS3 comes to family we all know that they are a pain to be ground sometimes! So instead of sleeping your cousins where you @MONTH1 get in a fight and even want to go home you can just talk to them for a little while through chat so you can leave the conversation whenever you want! Another great thing about the internet is school! Now some books are online and you don't have to even luggace them home like you used to! Research for projects is also so much easier all you have to do is go on a google and type @CAPS3 in instead of going through tons and tons of books @CAPS3 will take you only one click! Not only are high schools and middle schools using computers for schooling, some colleges even after courses at home on the computer! Nowadays laptops are required fro some schools and a great way to learn new knowledge. Overall computers are a great invention that are very much needed in our society not only do they reach they connect people and also are so much fun! Thats why computers are a great thing to have.",9
178,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I strongly believe that computers have a positive affect on people. Computers help teach important skills like hand-eye coordination, let people talk and interact with their friends and anyone can reaserch about history or facts on a sertain subject. I urge to you that computers do benifit society. What would you do everyday without a computer? @CAPS4 is a fact that @PERCENT1 of the world has a computer in their very own homes. I know that I use my computer every day. One of the most important things I use @CAPS4 for is school. Some childrens handwriting is so messy that not even their teacher can read @CAPS4 by when you are able to tye a @NUM1 page essay on @CAPS1 @CAPS2 you are not able to be neat but @CAPS4 saves time to. For example, @CAPS3 you are not sure how to spell a @CAPS2, you don't have to waste time looking @CAPS4 up in the dictionary, you can use spell check right or your. Also @CAPS3 you find mistakes while researching instead of earasing which is very messy you can highlight what is wrong and backspace @CAPS4. Computers are not just good for school but all of this helps you learn skills like hand eye coordination for when you are older and working! I can remember when I was a horrible typer, and @CAPS4 would take long type one paragraph. But now I speed! I beg you computers help our society! Computers do not only but @CAPS4 is very easy with technology like or @CAPS5 let you talk and about friends likes you to tell the way world! @CAPS3 you friend you dont have and sent @CAPS4 all the way through the mail taking your email is from you have a computer! this new technology people have been able to meet new friends that they never knew were right in their schools! Also with @ORGANIZATION3 you can not only email or @CAPS6 your friend but talk to them live and be able to see their face! I do acnoladge that yong chidren can suntimes use the internet to make fun of or other people but as long as you stay out of the drama @CAPS4 is great to use! I advise you that computers benifit everyone! @CAPS4 is true that every one learns somthing new everyday. Well computers with websights like @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS7.con or @CAPS8 allow anyone at anytime, look up anything! For example @CAPS3 you have a essay due the next day with no time to go to the library you are able to search the topic and gather the facts in a given amount of time. Many student and teachers rely on computers for this and without @CAPS4 they could get behind or confused. Computers arn't just good for researching for school but what @CAPS3 you were alergic to gluten? you could go online and not only search for good and what foods you can an a cannot eat but places where you can shop for the food too! In my opinion I strongly thing computer do help our society. Computers are helpful in many ways and they benifit us. You can learn skills, talk to friends and reaserch! I hope you agree because computers really make our society a better place.",10
179,"I think that computers benefit society. I think this because they give people the oppurtunity to improve hand eye coordination gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. First, one way computers benefit society is that they improve hand eye coordination. This is possible because when you use the computer you can't watch your wouldn't see what happening on the screen. Also the reason it benefits society is that you are now able to do a variety of things such as cook more, catch a ball, and drive a car. These all involve good hand-eye coordination and could lead to job oppurtunities like an athlete, cook, or driver, and obviously a computer tech. Furthermore, one way computers benefit society by teach hand-eye coordination. Next, a why computers benefit society is by giving the ability to learn about this is because the internet allows you to learn many things. Learning about faraway places would benefit society because people. Being open to change and can lead us to a better country and world. The other way learning about faraway places helps us that you learn about different cultures. This also helps because you can learn different. Learning these techniques can spice up your and lead to a buisness. Furthermore, benefits society. Last a way a computers benefit society is they allow people to talk to others online. This is very helpful because you @MONTH1 have a relative who lives far away but you dont have enough money and they, to visit. You can still talk online and not lose touch. Another way talking online helps is it brings people closer together. This is possible because someone you are friends with, but got in a fight or argument with, can talk to you face to face without any tension from being right there. This helps bring them closer by talking it out. Furthermore, talking to people on the internet or online benefits society by being able to talk face to face without being there. Finally, computers benefit society by teaching hand-eye coordination, allowing people to learn about faraway places and people, and letting people talk online. Just think what the world would be like and without them.",9
180,"Dear Newspaper, Computers have become a very large part of the world today, but the debate over if they have a positive or negative effect on people is ongoing. Computers have a negative effect on people. People use online social networking websites to reaplace real, human interaction. Also, people become addicted to their computer, and lose exercise by idly sitting at the computer. Computers do all the work for people such as finding words in passages so the people don't have to read, too. Computers definitely have a negative effect on people today. Websites such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and twitter have replaced face to face human interaction. People have lost natural social instincts. For example, when @NUM1 year old college student and @CAPS1 fan was asked how long a day she spends on @CAPS1 'connecting' with people compared to interacting with people face to face she said ""I spend about @NUM2 hours a night on @CAPS1 chatting and talking to my 'friends' and on average I'll see my friends in person about once every two weeks."" This college student has developed unhealthy habits and almost elimated all social, real interactions from her life. Now when she is in social situations, she feels akward and does not know what to say or how to act. Online interaction is having a negative effect on people. The more time that people spend on computers, the less time they will spend exercising. The less that people exercise, the more obese they will become. In a recent study of @CAPS4 families, an average on a week, night the family spent about @NUM3 times as much time on the computer! than they did exercising. When people should be exercising, they are going on the computer instead because it is less stressful and easily accessible. Computers are leading to an unhealthy world. Not only do people not use their muscles as much because of computers, but they also don't use their brains. @NUM4 out of every @NUM5 adults who own computers cannot even do long division because there is a calculator on the computer which can take the place of all math done out by hand or working through the problem in your head to find the answer. You then don't need to use any brain power of smarts to succeed in math. Furthermore, math becomes typing in numbers and pressing buttons. Also, if there is a full page of writing, you would not have to read the page because there is a 'find' button on the computer where you just type the word or phrase that you want it to and then in an instant you have found your answer without using any intelligence. Computers do all of the work for people and are making people stupid. Computers have a negative effect on people. They discourage real human interactions. they make people go on the computer more than they exercise and they are dulling people's intelligence. The more people that have computers, the worse the effect. Computers are a bad thing for humans.",10
181,"Dear newspaper, Computers do benefit socity because they help the community. It does have a positive effect on people of all ages. For more older people who don't really know how to work a computer, they can take classes. They can learn how to write on the computer. Play games, go on the internet etc. For more younger kids they can play educational games. Like a @CAPS1 game or a grammer game. Many people @DATE1 go on their computer to learn about far away places such as @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3 and @LOCATION1. They learn all about there culture and traditions. Its much better on the internet than having to buy tickets and going on the flight. You can talk to people online. Mostly teenagers do it, but some more older people do it to. They have e-mails, aim, facebook and text messaging. There are many positive effects for people who have computers. They lengthen their vocabulary, chat with friends learn about the world etc. To make a long story short, computers do have a positive effect on people. ",7
182,"@PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 have computors. Is it good or bad for people to use computors? I do believe that computors benifit society. Computors are benefitial in society because computors teach hand eye coordination, give people chance to learn about far away places and allows people to talk to people they might not be able to see often. Computors teach hand eye coordination. Using the keyboard helps kids not rely on sight but on memory. If children learn to this out of memory then they might learn how to do other things like dribbling a basket ball or kicking a soccer ball with out looking at the ball. On a computor they have fast paste video games that make people better at using there hands. Unlike playing sports there is no chance of getting hurt playing video games to make you alert. Hand eye coordination helps children be successful in life says my doctor. Sure you can learn hand eye coordination in other ways but non or as easy as on the computor. Being on a computor can teach you about far away places in an inexpensive way. If you are studing places in geography that look interesting and you want to see more of that place you can look it up on the internet. On the internet you would probably be able to find thousands of websites with information on the topic. This is benifical because it gives you background knowlegde on the subject. There are many amazing places or objects you would like to go to but you cannot because it is too expensive. On a computor you are able to see these places without having to travel. Sure you could just look these places up in books but this takes too much time. You are able to talk to friends and family online. If one of your friend have moved to a far away place you will still be able to communicat with them. You don't want to loose a freind because of lack of communication do you? If you live in @LOCATION1 and one of your family members live in another country like @LOCATION2 you will not go all the way to @LOCATION2 if you want to see how they are doing if you could just do it on line talking to them online is like being in the same room with them. In conclusion, I believe that computors are benefical in society. Computors allow you to learn hand eye cooridination, learn about far away places, and communitcate with freinds and family. Its now or never do you believe that computors are benifical to society or not. Computors can be benifical to communty. Are they or are they not you deside.""",9
183,"Dear newspaper reporters, I think that we should keep computers. They're good for people to do their homework, research for a project their doing in school, and you need them if you have an iPod or anything like that to charge and put stuff on them. Some people say that kids are spending too much time on computers and less time exercising, but I think the good things overule them. Sometimes you might need a computer to do research for homework or an inclass project. Or maybe some students like to type their work on the computer. That might be better for some students who don't have good handwriting, like me, which is why I'm doing this @CAPS1 on the computer right now. I think more than @PERCENT1 of people will agree after they read this. If you have a portable electronic device that requires a computer, to charge it or put things like music, videos, pictures, apps., etc, how will you do that? I have a @CAPS2 player, and it needs a computer. I can't charge it or put music on it without one. Also, I think at least @PERCENT1 of people with jobs need a computer. My dad's job is to work with computers, so he can't not have one either. If he didn't, I don't know what his work would be doing. In conclusion, I think we should keep computers for the benefiting reasons. If you have a problem with your kids, set a time limit on how long they can be on the computer, and then say they have to exercise. Please take my suggestion!",8
184,"Do computers keep people from enjoying the outside world? I think that computers take up peoples time and don't allow them to go outside. The first reason is people spend too much time on computers and get loss exercise. The second reason is computers don't allow you to enjoy nature. Finally computers keep you from interacting with family and friends. Without a doubt computers keep people from enjoying the outside world. People spend too much time on computers and get less exercise. If people eat junk food and other non nutrious food and go on the computer and no exercise it could cause them to gain weight. If people gain to much weight and still go on the computer, at same they will become obese. Exercise is great to maintain yourself fit and active and allows you to use and move your body. While on the computer you only use your hands which is not exercise. People spend of there time on computers and less enjoying nature. It is really wonderful to walk in beach or go for a walk at the park and leting the wind blow across your face instead of siting on a seat glancing at your computer. People have better times go out, breathing fresh, leting the sun touch their skin but on the other hand people look at pictures on nature on their computer which most be really dull. It is better to experience stuff in real life than on your computer screen. No doubt it is better to enjoy nature in real life. It is really for to interact with family and friends than chating online. You get to go on family food trip amusement parks which is a so much cooler experience than chating with friends. You can have play with friends and actually do correcting instead of typing on your keyboard. Interacting with your family and friends is active, fun and could be adventurous computer. No question interacting with family and friends is better than being on your computer. As you can see going out and having fun is better than being on the computer. The first reason is you exercise and go less time on your computer. The second reason is you enjoy nature. The final reason is you interact with friends. The real world is better than the world that is in your computer.",9
185,"In my opinion computers benefit the society very much. They can have a very positive effect on all of the people who use a computer. For instance computers can teach you about far away places and people that you might never get to see or know about otherwise. You can also meet a whole bunch of new people online. You can make new friends or even find someone to spend the cool of your life with. Computers also have a program you can type your papers and have them checked. @PERCENT1 of all college students say that typeing in much faster and easier to do than writing. Wouldn't you went to be able to write papers much faster, and have than instantly ? Computers can teach you many things, exspecially about different places around the world. If you wanted to know what the capitol of brazil was then you could just the computer and look it up, easy. It would be much slower if you had to drive to the library, look it up then go work have. The would be wasting gas too, which is very expensive right than. there is so much on the computer that you could find anything. Say you would in know with a deep like, just computer and look it up. one time I . So I went to the computer and typed along with the music video and to the thing. I had found all . Computers meeting . you can @NUM1 out of online. That is a lot of people. You can also meet people you just want to be friends. With online, say like a . Instead of which , exspecially a across the ocean, you can use email. Email is also almost instant. You can have more conversations and become faster friends than just through letters. If you have to write papers for college or work, it is much faster and easier to type it! Many college students have laptops they around with then to type notes and do homework @PERCENT2 of college students say that it is easier to type notes and homework. They say this because if they make a mistake, the computer will automatically fix it. So they can just type without having to go back and fix mistakes themselves. With a computer you can also project what is on it to a big acreen. That way you don't have to wrote a whole of paper copies. Don't you want do less paper do save tress? All of these reasons benefit the do a great . Using a computer helps you learn about new places and people, meet new peopl, and write need, planted or school. So computers are a great benefit to our society and will continue to be even better.",9
186,"Dear @CAPS1. T @CAPS2, @CAPS3 you know im writing to you about the effect computers have on people. I would agree that computers do benefit society because it allows us to learn anything we want to learn. Computers also help kids in school when they need research of a specific topic. My first reason on how computers benefit society is it helps us kids & teens have information on anything in the world. In fact just @DATE1 the computer helped me in my research for black history and found that very useful. Besides research it has practically everything you need to know from A-@CAPS4. The next reason why computers benefit society is by letting us communicate with other people around the world by using special websites like a skype or @CAPS5. When we can talk to people around the world you could be tought a new language or learning about another foreign culture. Our computer also help people paybills and do takes online and saving time rather than doing it by hand because they have or her block. Third I can see how the computer is bad for you but thats why they have games like dance dance revolution or rockland because a study has been taken that playing rockland you can burn @NUM1 calories for playing @NUM2 mins which way most sound like alot so imagine playing for @NUM3 mins, you could burn up to @NUM4 calories which is equivalent to eating a @NUM5 calories pack. Finally, just get on a computer and see how much fun it is to use wheather your playing a game or talking to other people online or researching a project or question. The computer can benefit you!",8
187,"Dear newspaper editor, I believe that computers do benefit because the increase our knowledge, computers also help in socializing because write to them and they help till time. The first reason that computers helps us is by letting us about learn about topics that would've been otherwise unknown, for example, you can learn about distant countries and locations.  Imanige, not knowing what's out your state, or even your distant. That path would be cruel. The most important knowledge the computer gives us is the knowledge about business and stocks which in were changing unvichles are would never know. Knowing business helps later because the knowledge will get you a job  is your source pf money The money, like everyone knows will increase the quality of life. Another good reason, which helps the the computer helps with people @CAPS1 you world where without seeing them in person? As With the computer, you can keep by Which and hand speed as well as objects. Hence @PERSON1, computer and all of technology s not a badthing and is a good progression.",6
188,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 you like to keep in touch with your family and see how their doing or @CAPS1 yo be fine that you will never be in contalk with them? Yes I do agree that computers benefits society because computers help students learn more faster and easier, computers will help you keep in toch with your family, and their cheap. Computers will help students learn more faster ans easier in nschool and aven at home. For @CAPS2 in @LOCATION1 middle school students are doing this daily @CAPS4 proname it's called @CAPS3 @CAPS4. Im takeing this proname too, we @CAPS1 go down to the computer lab on @DATE1, and @DATE2. Know ill really bad at @CAPS4 it takes one weeks to learn something so im thinking cool we get use computers every student in the school lone computers. The prgrane teaches everything about @CAPS4. Frist teaches your times table chart witer I hate! When I get on the computers I allready learned ny @NUM1 times table it was so @CAPS3 I memroized every fact and it was really fun and @CAPS3. The computers help students learn @CAPS3! Its easier for them because you know how class and a teacher's walks by you and looks aven well kids think their doing something wrong and when your have this class clear then we @CAPS1 love to stop the and we to all himto settle above. Well thats wasting time for students this computers helps us! Also the great scientis @PERSON1 her did on expirment on coumputers to see if they help students learn more and esier to asked half the school @MONEY1 @CAPS5 to learn about or re goverment by text and the other half to learn about it an computers. The data shows that only @PERCENT1 @MONEY1 student learn from.Know if computers the other half @MONEY1 student learn form computers the percentage will increase! Computers keep in touch with your family. For @CAPS2. @MONEY1 @MONEY1 @MONEY1 people all around use computer's to keep in touch with their family member's. Computers help keep in touch abd in case a family member is in trouble their family could com and help. If there wernt computer's then people @CAPS1 be mesiarble I know I @CAPS1 be not knowing if your family members are safe is very hard. How @CAPS1 you feel if you couldnt keep in toch with your family? this @MONEY1 @MONEY1 people being happy will drope. In addition to this I read a @CAPS7 about a kid who was living with his aunt and where in the @CAPS8.S and his mom was in @LOCATION2 molding. His aunt and where didnt have a computer so how was he suppose to keep in toch? well they didnt the was so sach he gone crazy and sick that he died! computers help us stay with are family. Computers are very cheap know a days and could help the econmie. For @CAPS2 computer's are @NUM2 @NUM3 a day's so a lot @MONEY1 people are buying them this is bringing money into the econmie. The money can help pay for the army, built shelter's, and it can help are town get better. Also, are @CAPS10 @PERSON2 said ""having computer will make you succeful, and save you mony!""",10
189,"Dear Local news, @CAPS1 people are addicted to the computer. Did you know that about @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 and adults are addicted to the computer? Acording to @PERSON1, a professer for @NUM1 years says, ""@CAPS2 we did the studies about computers we were noticing that the amount of @CAPS3 and adults using the computer was a huge amount of population"". As you noticed, using the computer is very common especially if you have one at home you get addicted. One you touch the mouse, you wouldn't want to get off. If you go on the computer and you have things to do the next day, trust me you won't have time, to do what you have to do. It's like the computer you down and not letting you go. And instead of you not paing attention its feed in. A formal amistad academy student named @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 reports to us ""I have a serious problem, once I get home at @TIME1 I go streight to the computer. I stay there from @TIME1@NUM2 a.m. I don't get much sleep and I don't do my homework because im addicted to the computer."" @CAPS3 can get exausted but they don't care they still go on no matter what time. Since we heard the student @ORGANIZATION1. She brought me to my next point about homework. If @CAPS3 don't react fast they will have bad grades in school. Acording to @CAPS4 songs, a principal for @NUM3 years announces that @NUM4 of @CAPS3 don't do their homeworke because they are into the computer. The world is not recognizing what the computer is doing to their young adults and how it's inpacting on them. @CAPS1 @CAPS3 don't go outside, spend time with their families, or friends just to be on the computer. @NUM5 of @CAPS3 all over the world decide to spend time at home in the internet then to join their families to an important place or just to be with them. We might be young but we only live once and we have to make the best of it and not stay on the computer. So this question is for you to think about! Its now or never, are you going to quit or feed into it? Are you going to be one of the @NUM6 people to be addicted acording to the widsome technology program's data? Think about your actions because at the end your choice just impact you and your behaviors.",9
190,"Computers do have a good benefit on our society. I know this because computers teach, computers make things easier, and they are not a big impact on most lives. These things make computer a good thing to have in the world. Every kid at some point or another in their school experience will learn to type. typing is a ciriculum in most schools. Without computers this would not be possible. Computers also teach people about places they have never been and @MONTH1 never go. If you live in the country and didn't have a computer, you @MONTH1 never know what kind of world in outside your small farm. Last, computers teach social skills and about different people. Most kids have @CAPS1 and talk to each other every night, being social. People with different cultures are all over the internet for people to learn about. Computers teach things that some schools can't by themselves. Computers make humans lives easier because of what they are of. Have you ever been to a library without an @ORGANIZATION1 system? I haven't, but @CAPS2 would be hard to find the book you're looking for without that computer. In school we learn how kids in the old times always wrote on chalk boards. When I go to write an essay I want to type it and not write it out(especially). Typeing it also makes the essay easier for the teacher to read. Some kids have. Last, my mom works from home and she relys on her laptop to get work done. laptops make things easier for working can work home. Laptops are good in our society because they make things easier. I don't think that computers have a huge bad impact on peoples lives. How many adults have you seen playing away from on the computer. Many adults get up and get fresh air whenever they can. Computers a huge impact on kids because their parents watch them closely. Every one while you will a parent kid play on the computer. parents how much time. Last, computer are not the only electronic in the world. There are @CAPS3's, @CAPS4, play stations, and many more. So, computers aren't the only electronic causing problem. on that note, computer don't have a huge bad impact on people. In conclusion, computer have a good benifit in our society. They teach 'us, make everyday things easier, and don't have a huge bad effect on society. So, we should stop blaming computers for the reasons why less people can going outside and getting exercise.",9
191,"Computers are amazing pieces of technology. We as the human race have come so far to develop this fantastic machine. Some people think that they do not benefit society and I am not one of those people. I believe computers can help you in so many ways hand-eye coordination on giving students a way to learn about almost anything even having the ability to chat online can help you. Sure, playing catch with dad can teach you hand-eye coordination but so can computers. The benefit to using a computer over catch is that you are constanly your skills no matter what you decide. You could be playing a game, chatting with a friend or even typing one and you still be moving had-eye coordination. One friend of mine with a disebility began to use the computer ar a very young age. By the time she was out of @NUM1 grade her parents said that ger hand-eye coordination had improve dramatically because of her use of the computer ther had at home. I never thought that using a computer could help somebody about much somebody asked, ""@CAPS1 isnt it better to go outsick play and catch instead of being lazy and using the computer all day?"" I do agree with that, but I think using computers are benificial as long as you only spend a limited amount on it per week. The rest of the time you can go any out with friends or play your favorite sport. You are in social studies class and you have to make a project on same place across the globe. How do you learn about this faraway place? to your computer and look it up on the web. I believe researching online os much better than reading about it in a book. Why? When using the internet you can search the exact information you need instead looking through all of books. The computer will save you a lot of time when researching. Research shows that student prefer to go to a website with colors, links and pictures as oppose to boring textbook. In addition to improving hand-eye coordination and learning about facinating around the world, computers can help with communication. Not only can you instant message your best friend in @LOCATION1 but you can video chat with your cousin too! I love to see my cousins hit rarely can, so I video chat with er instead. Video achatting, email and instant messaging are all ways to communicate over the computer many more. This your has ll been about trying to the placed and going green and believe it or not but computers are helping a lot with that instead of wasting paper by writing a letter, you can send her an email. Not only does it save a lot of trees but the message gets to her much faster in about @NUM2 seconds to be specific. Computers have saved a lot of time and money computers go back a long time ago, and have developed into great pieces of technology today. Just to recap, the wonderful device can improve hand-eye coordination give people a better and quicker way to learn about the world and so in unusual ways help save the environment. Plus, almost most every college requires that you have a computer and know hot to use it if you don't use a computer or don't have one, you can go to your local library a friend. You might be surprised the things you can do with one.",9
192,"Dear local newspaper, I have been seeing many adults, kids, work company using computers now a days. My opinion about this is bad for @NUM1 main reasons most things you do on a computer you can do in real life. Most funs things in life you can't do in real life, and being on computer gives no exercise at all. Would you want to fat? I ask this because when your on a computer your not doing anything to give no exercise. The rate of obesidity vs increasing @PERCENT1 of the population every year. This means eventually everyone in the @LOCATION1 will be fat. This could just be solved by ether not supporting the advances of computers or exercising after your on the computer. Would you want to go @CAPS1 world! If your on a computer you can't enjoy something as if you where actually there. You can read about @CAPS2 or see pictures, but @CAPS2 will never be the same feeling as if you actually went on that ride or eating that ice cream. What is the point of a computer if you can do @CAPS2 in real life? You can do many things that computers does. For example if you need to find a word instead of looking @CAPS2 up on the you can. My friend once said, ""@CAPS2's easier to open a dictionary and turn to a page then to turn on your computer and look up a definition. Knowing all the facts why do you use a computer when you can do @CAPS2 in real life, why you want obesidity, or why would you wont to look at something if you could actually go there. Now go and tell your child to stop playing on the computer or stop yourself.",8
193,"Dear Local newspaper, I strongly believe that people are spending too much time on their computers and spending less time with their family and friends. I also believe that being in @CAPS1 of the computer all the time is distracting them from getting their homework done and grades are dropping. Also these people would starve to death just to not get out the computer and walk to make themself something to eat their health is not good. My first reason why I believe with this statement is because theres to many people that stay at home all day on the computer and they don't go visit there family and friends spend time with them go out for dinner done of that they just want to be home on the computer. Secondly there grades are dropping and they not doing there homework because as soon they get out of school they go straight to the computer. I feel that education comes first. Thirdly people are lazy and when they are attached to the computer they don't want to get up and make themself some food. I am concern because they is not taking care of their health. These are the reason's why I believe that people are spending too much time on the computer than with family and friends or doing homework or eating taking care their health.",7
194,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 you know about @PERCENT1 of human race spends their time on the computer. You might say that is ridiculous, but its true. In almost ever home the have either a desktop computer or a laptop, rather they use it for research, communication, or even just to have fun, but I know some people think different. Some people think that computers are stopping or keeping people from exercising, enjoying nature, and even stopping them from interacting with family and friends. Now I think that is stupid, but if you still don't agree with me read on. Why do people say that computers stop some people from exercising and having fun. When you can have fun and you can exercise on the computer. I know you are thinking how can you exercise on the computer. To tell the truth it is simple all you have to do is decide what time of exercise do you want. Once you do that, it is your decision to do the exercise or not so people need to stop blaming things like on the computer because its not the computers falt that some people are just to lazy to do any exercise. Plus you can have fun on the computer. You can play games, and you can even shop on the computer now. Just try you just might like it. Are you enjoying this research about nature on your computer. I bet you are. In your head I know you are probably saying that you can go out side and enjoy nature or read a book and enjoy nature, but say you see a pretty flower and you don't know what it is called and you want to learn more about it, but your book doesn't have that specific flower in. So the only choice you have is to use your computer to find the information on your beautiful flower but you do more than find a research on a flower on the computer you can look up things in history that you didn't know or you can even find out things about your favorite animal or even your favorite sports team or player. You still don't with me about the computers, if you don't then just read on. Alright now from information I have found out that you think peop can't communicate nor interact with each other using a computer, but they can. Some people use computers to communicate with their family members and their friend. They would even be able to see each other if they have a webcam, but say that their is some that doesn't have a phone and they are able unable to go out side. They only way they can communicate is by a computer. Still it there are people out their that would sit in front of the computer than go and sit out sit with their families than that is their buiness. Now I know you agree with me now. Its not the computers fault that some people are just to lazy to do anything but sit there and stare at the computer. It's their buisness it they don't have fun, or communicate or even get off their buts and exercise, that is their buisness.",10
195,"Dear newspaper editor, @CAPS1 are a great advancement in technology. They are helpful lin life however they take away a lot of your life. People use computers too much and not enough time exercising, being outside, and spending time with friends or family. The @CAPS1 does have a negative affect on people. People dont exercise enough any more. Fewer and fewer people go to the gym every month. The reason for this is because of other things, like computers, to ocupy their time. Computers are used for people to do school work, fun, or for their job. Children do home work and type essays all the time on the @CAPS1. They also play games on the internet or go on websites to talk with friends like @CAPS2. Even adults use computers at work or work at home with a @CAPS1. With all that is availible on a @CAPS1, when will people workout? This hapens to be one of the leading causes for weight gain in the @LOCATION1. No one exercises their body anymore, just their hand on the mouse and eyes on the screen. Fresh air is one of the most refreshing things outside. People dont take advantage of these wonderful things in nature because they lock themselves inside and use the @CAPS1. Peoples lives revolve around the @CAPS1 so much, that they dont camp, fish, or swim anymore. The @CAPS1 doesn't move away from sight of some kids. That isn't healthy at all. Going outside and playing sports is however. Trees and forests are being cut down more and more and soon there wont be much left. Get up from the @CAPS1 and go out before it is too late and nothing is left. Soon you will learn about wilderness by the @CAPS1 and the @CAPS1 alone. When do you see your whole family in a year? Christmas? Thanksgiving? That is not enough. You should spend most of your live with relatives or even just friends. Talking face to face with them is not a usual thing for people anymore. Now you can comunicate through typing on the @CAPS1. It isn't the same as talking in person. The @CAPS1 cant send you their expression on their face when you tell a joke. All it will tell you is @CAPS3 @CAPS3 @CAPS3 or @CAPS6. But what is that to you? Just another word or phrase. Plus, a @CAPS1 cant give you a hug to show the other persons affection towards you. You cant hear their voice or their laugh, or see their face unless you spend time with them. Computers cant keep you warm at night people do. As you can see, computers are on advance in technology, but use too much of our time. Computers dont help us lose weight, see the wilderness, or give you love like a family does. You cant replace your life because you reglet wasteing it on the @CAPS1 @CAPS7 it is gone it is gone for good. If you let it a @CAPS1 will completely consome you life.",10

197,"Dear newspaper, @CAPS1 you imagen living in a world with out any computers? Computers help you get in contact with anyone, gives you the ability to learn faraway places and gives you all the education you need. This is why I believe that having computer benefits society. While your setting infront of your computer being on a website like facebook.com and you notice many @CAPS3 people who joined that website. You start to notice a picture of one of your old friends from years ago, and you quickly get in with them. This is how the internet and computers @CAPS2 show that @PERCENT1 of people who have computer find their long lost friends, sisters,parent and many more. I remember a time when my mom was on the computer chating with a friend of hers from @NUM1 years ago. When my mom found her she was very jubilant than she invited her over and they got to catch up on so many things. Wouldn't you like that to be you, finding many of your old friends and siblings? The computer has so many websites that help you learn about the world, and helps you get to so many places that you never heard about. The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 magazine states that the computer helps many people get to places with having the exact direction of them. Statistic shows that at least @PERCENT2 of the people who go on vacation tpo faraway places use many websites, such as @ORGANIZATION1 to get to where they need to go. In having computer would help out so many people who help out so many people who are @CAPS3 to states like conneticute. Do you remember back in time when you were more months of school you, quit? Now having computers and the internet would help out so many young kids even grown ups still get the education they need. @CAPS2 that I found out was that at least @PERCENT3 of people take online classes to get the education they mused. A proffesional @CAPS6 @PERSON1 said that from the @PERCENT3 of people who take online classes more than @PERCENT2 pass with a diploma or degree. Wouldn't you want that to be you? In conclusion, having computers will definitly benefit the society in many ways. Computers would help because it will give people a chance to get in contact with anymore give the ability to learn faraway places and most importantly get the education they need had. Thats why @NUM2 believe having computers is a good idea.",9
198,My opinion about computers is that they help hand-eye coordination. This is good as it helps retiexes and reaction time improve. Also you can learn about famous people and places. So this has to be good for the brain. This is why I think computers have very good effects on the human brain.,2
199,"Dear @CAPS1 paper, I think that the evolving technology has a better impact on society with newer technology things become more portable and brings people together. Technology also keeps people from being bored. First off the old computers were un realistic. They took up whole rooms and were slow. Now computers or anything technological can fit in a pocket. Computers are a lot faster and more reliable. Being portable also allows people to go anywhere and still be connected. With technology comes connections. People are able to talk to people halfway across the world with technology. Cellphones are a great idea also. A child could get lost in the mall, or an adult get lost in the. Either way, the person can call for help. Television allows a person to be updated on whats happening around them. We all know what its like to be completely bored. But, with new technology, anybody can be entertained. There are games online music, endless possibilities. Now @CAPS2 are becomming less bored. By not being bored, @CAPS2 wont eat whenever they feel like it, therefore they are healthier. People can still exercise, enjoy nature, and interact with their family and friends. They can do it all with technology. Technology is portable, allowing people to go into nature with it. People can be connected with technology. Boredom is also cut down with advances in technology.",7
200,"I will be writing about people that like learning computers. Also people that don't like learning about computers. First I will be talking about people that like computers. For example, people like learning hand-eye cordinate, learning faraway places and people. Also to talk online with friend and other people. People could learn how to create their on website. Like myspace that was created by a guy. People love spending alot of time on their computer. Which is sometimes not good for them. They could sometimes get blind and they nees glasses. When they are myspace and they talk to somebody and that person didn't mean that he or she said they could cause trouble. Thats why being on the computer its not good. Sometimes is good or bad being on the computer or not being on the computer. eople like doing exercising and not being on the computer. People also don't like doing exercise and like being on the computer. So people could do both couple of hours doing exercise and a couple of hours playing or being on the computer. Now people can't complane for spending to much time being on the computer or complaning that people exercise for no reason. This is the reasson why people like learning about computer. Also people that don't like being on the computer. So this is my story that I talked to you about.",8
201,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects of people using computers then going outside is if you stay, inside all day doing nothing but sitting by the computer is a waist of time. What's so important on the computer that catches anyones attention like really I know you can e-mail friends, family but you can also call them and meet up somewhere so you can got out to eat or go hang out or something because staying home on the computer is'nt realy healthy fer you I mean like you can miss out on a lot like a birthday party or maybe someone in his/her family past away or just a speacial event that someone wants you to go to. So you can support them but if your just at home sitting on your butt on the computer no one is going to be needing you. Matter a fact they'll probably forget about you and then when you need them they want be there to help you out because you weren't there for them so thats why we we should all get up and hang up the mouse and put it to rest and go outside to have some fun.",7
202,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I agree that computers benefit society. Some of my reasons are: They teach hand-eye coordination, gives kids and parents the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and lastley you can talk with friends and family members. Hand-eye coordination isvery helpful. When children get older most jobs deal with computers and they will need to learn how to type. Studies show that @PERCENT1 more people that know how to type howe better jobs then people what don't. Gives people the ability to learn about faraway people and places and maybe even religons. With computers people will learn about other king of people around the world. They can learn what they eat, what time these school starts in the @TIME1, and much more. You can also learn about places like @LOCATION1, @CAPS1, france and many other places. There are pictures, descriptions, and the type of animals life there. Lastley you an learn about people's religons. My last reason computers benifit society is that you can talk to people on certain websites. Is you have family members that live faraway you can talk to them or video chat with them. Maybe your bestfriend moved across the country you can also talk to them on websites like @ORGANIZATION2, twitter, facebook, and @CAPS2. Even though computers are fun and helpful you should always take some time to go outside and enjoy nature. Thats why I think computers benifit society. They teach hand-eye coordanation, give people the ability to learn about faraway places, and talk to family or friends.",8
203,"Dear The @CAPS1 Have you ever been bullied before? Cyberbullying is worse and it is not fun. Computers can be quite dangerus and very time consuming. Some people spend hours and some times days on the computer. It gets in the way of many activities and deprives time from friends and family. Many people that spend most of ther tim on the computer becom over whieght due to lack of exersize. ""@CAPS2 get about @NUM1 calls a month complaining about cyber bulling. And some suasidal atempts."" says officer @PERSON2 ove the @CAPS3 police department. Being cyber bullied is a very dandurus situation. Sights such as @CAPS4, A.I.M., @CAPS5 and @CAPS6, are all sights that people can be bullied on. @PERSON3 spends most of his time on the computer. He stays on for hours and hours at a time. One @CAPS1 his mom had to go out of town. She left him a list of things he needed to do by the time she got back: clean room, practice trombone, walk the dog, do homework, feed the dog, and work on a project for boy scouts. @PERSON3 got on the computer and did not get off untill his mom got home. None of the things on the list were done. He got in huge trouble. Did you know that kids miss @PERCENT1 of there family bonding time while they ar on the computer? ""More half of my patients are obece because they are on the computer when they should be going outside, running around, working out walking the dog are exersising in general. This makes it harder for them to loes wheight"" says @PERSON1, spesialist in wheight, gain, loss, obesity, exersise and diet. People should be exersizing much more instaid of sitting @CAPS1 after @CAPS1 at the computer. It's not healthy. Computers arn't really benifiting our sasiaty. They are putting as in many ways. People should get off the computer more and do something active.",8
204,"Dear newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion for this letter is that we should have computers because it can help you and they are better and the technogy is better. First is that computers can help you learn how to type. If you did not have one back in the day. They also can help you learn about people that were or are famous. Also you can look up things like the news and what happened back then. You can make charts for school, work, or even home on the computer. When you what to travel you can buy tickets online and maybe get goods seats. These are a few reasons why the computers are helpful. Second the computers are way better tha type writers because they are less work for you. Because when type writers were around the buttons were hard to push and you had to push the proper back and froth. But if you have a compter it is a lot easier, the keys are light to push and the computer auto-madicly goes on the other line itself. You don't need to keep putting paper in the computer because does that for you too. This is why compters are way better than a typewriter. Finally is that technoly is better because back in the day you had to write letters to people and had to wait for weeks for it to come back. Or it might get lost in the mail room so the person might never get it. But with compters you can send an e-mail to people and the can get in two seconds flat. And it is a lot faster than mailing a letter in the mail. And this is why technology is way better than sending letter in the mail than just sending on computer. @CAPS1 opion is that we should have computers because it can help us much better.",8
205,"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers! Who needs them any way I know not @CAPS1 people do! Computer effect anyone for various reasons just like a viris or spam that leads to your computer being broken. Yet there are still worse like cyber bulling and scams that can bring you down to debt. Now I you to listen up and head on. One reason computers are iritating is their virises they sound all over the internet just waiting to eat your computer away. About @PERCENT1 of people who use the computer get shut down by a viris. Soon messages do the same they pop-up right on the screen sometimes saying ""You have just won the million dollar prize"" @CAPS1 people are careless enough and just click the message, as then another box pops up asking for impormation. This is where scams come in. Another reason would be scams. Scams are one of the worst, like I said about an information box will pop-up asking @LOCATION1 , @CAPS2 security number, phone number, adress and name. How is doing enter, some scams will show you much you said. @CAPS1 people claim they dont pay a, but they actually did it @CAPS3 in debt. My last example who computer cyber bullying, over @PERCENT2 of people. Cyber bulling is when one person on the internet or a or brings them big verbal, now you dont want that to you, do you? I remember when kids hated me and picked on me, @CAPS4 I stayed home but get on the. I still get @CAPS4 now what ever you do just do the right thing and don't be like me or any other american that has a time with any computer just don't.",8
206,"Dear Newspaper editor, @CAPS1 this, you're late for an interview when you realize you've forgotten the address you were emailed. So you hop on the computer, but before you know it it's been an hour! This is because I think computers are very time consuming and you don't enjoy everything that's around you. You also don't spend enough time exersizing because people are always infront of on a computer, and finally you should be talking to people face to face, it would build a better relationship between you. So please listen to why I thin computers can be an agrivating item in people's lives. When you first go on a computer, your first thought is mostly, ""@CAPS2, only for a minute,"" @CAPS3, that minute can turn into an hour before you know it. This is because when you're of something and there are so many possibilities of what you could do, you want to do them all, and everything is pretty much docked out. So you wouldn't realize what time had gone by, anything that was going on around you. How many times have you gone up to someone on the computer and said something to them, and you just got a nod, or maybe even no response back? I know I have, because you don't really hear what people are saying to you, because your so-hipnotized and focuse don what's happening on the computer. Secondly, if you're always on the computer, you're not getting enough time for exersizing and fresh air. You can't just be kept inside not moving all day, more and more people all over the world have been gaining wait for lack of exersize. Do you really want to see yourself, your family being in front of the computer? Of course not! you want to see them healthy having fun, and outdoors! Also, when you're on the computer, and it is very time consumming. You won't be able to get what you need to do, like papers, homework, bills, anything! More so, yes, you can talk to many people over the computer, but wouldn't much rather see them in person. When you talk to someone over the computer it can be very dangerous sometimes, also many people are more willing to say harsher things when it's over the computer and not face to face. And wouldn't you rather sorte a conflict out comly, then using bash mean language? Also when you're talking to someone in person, face to face; it builds a better relationship between you two. Iwould much rather being hanging out, outside playing with my bestfriend, than gossipping on the computer with her. Also since people are more willing to say things not face to face, if you didn't go on the computer as much it would be easier and not as many arguments. In conclusion, I think that we shouldn't be on the computer as much because it 's very time consuming and wasteful, people need to be spending more time outside and exersizing to stay healthy, and finally, people should be talking more face to face because it would build a better relationship. So please listen to my pleading, People need to stop spending so much time on the computor, for all of these reasons and many more.",10
207,"To whom @CAPS6 my concern, I think computers are great to have in socity. I believe this because @CAPS6 allows you to talk to your friends. Share information with relatives far away and lastley @CAPS6 tells you about local news and weather. I will explain this more if you read on. First of all did you ever get out of school and say ""I was supposed to tell someone something""? I know I have. With computers you can see if your friend was online and instant message them on @CAPS1 or @CAPS2. Also if you live in a large town and there is more than one school you can meet some one that goes to a different school, and stay in touch with them. This is good because you can make more friends. I rember when I was a littler kid and met this kid from pre school if I had a computer I could of still known that kid but I don't anymore. Second of all if you have family or friends far away from you or even in a differnt country you can stay in touch with them. this is helpful when they have mybe a baby they can send you pictures of @CAPS6. For example when I was about @NUM1 or @NUM2 my cusin @CAPS3 moved to @CAPS4. He had a baby boy and he emailed my family in @CAPS5 pictures of him. If we did not have computers I would of never seen him till they come to visit. Lastley computers keep you in touch with local news and weather. This is great because I would know if there was a forrest fire in @LOCATION1. If you say you can whatch the news and weather on tv your right and wrong. What happins if you have a broken tv or even if you missed the new program and @CAPS6 wont be on a couple of hours. I rember when @CAPS6 was @NUM3 oclock in the @TIME1 and @CAPS6 started pooring rain and my mom was flying in. I went on the computer to look if @CAPS6 was passing. I never would of know if she could fly into the air port if idident have a computer. In conclution you can see the computer is one of the best tools you can own. I say this because you can talk with your friends, get information from far away family and friends. Lastley you can check local wether and events. I hope this esay changed your mind about computers beining bad.",9
208,"Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1 are some of the reason way I think computers are good for people who live in other states can keep in context with there family. Another is it can help you with when your at work. Lastly, @ORGANIZATION1 a high school in @LOCATION1 who works with computers everyday. @CAPS1 are my three reasons way computers are not just good there helpful. First keeping in context with your family. Say a family member move to @LOCATION2 you haven't talk to them in days, then a death pops up in the family its his grandma. He has no phone but they do have a labtop you can @CAPS2-mail him or her. Then they can come down to the funerl and share his or her memory of there grandma. that a key reason way computers are good for you. Second, when people go to work, they sometimes need a computer to help them plan meets have lunchs, and maybe even partys. Teachers use the for puting grades in it then find the total grade for the marking period. I hate to say this but you cant lie you guys probadly use them too. That another great reason why computers helpful. Lastly, @ORGANIZATION1 good school. But they made there whole school around computers. Students get to know what homework is by there computers. Also classes when there in art class it helps. then at the end of the day you got to take it home and keep throughout the school year. That a good thrid reason why computer helpful. Those three reason explain why computers are helpful and they don't have a effect on people. One you type need for staying in context with family. Second you need them for work. lastly, students need them at @ORGANIZATION1 for classes, homework, and others. @CAPS1 are way computers don't effect the community they help the community. ",8
209,"Dear Newspaper, A lot of people are talking about if having computers effects are society. In my opinion, I somewhat think that's true. @CAPS6 just seens people spend a lot of time on the computers. And this is effecting are society because this can lead to life changing conditions, @CAPS6's stopping us to live a healthy life, and @CAPS6 impacts your body. My first reason was that @CAPS6 can lead to life changing conditions. And what I mean by that is sevarl sites on the computer contain graphics, and flashs. And my next door neighbor's son @PERSON2, always went on the computer. And in a result he had a seizure. @CAPS6's reala sad, but @CAPS6 happened, now seizures became part of @PERSON2's life... That's something you @MONTH1 want to take in considerations. Another thing I thought was that @CAPS6 was stopping us from living a healthy life. Nutrition expert @PERSON1, quoted: ""I use to be fat, I always hated exercising, and two of those reasons was because of playing videogames and staying on the computer. And those two things prevented me from living healthy. Ten years later I lost some weight because I was committed to stop playing games and stay off the computer. "" In my opinion this says a lot. Finally my last reason about computers is that @CAPS6 really impacts your body. Going on computers no exercise, and no fresh air builds a bad habit. @CAPS6 means your @CAPS1-A-@CAPS2-@CAPS3 @CAPS4!! and @CAPS6 really does change your personality. I took a quick little surevey. @CAPS6 said of @CAPS5 that don't have jobs, but have computers in household. The computers makes us @CAPS4 enough that we can't even apply for a job... this needs to be a wake-up call. Concluding this I think having computers are okay but having too much isn't. I know the debate would still be going on. But I just wanted you guys to know were I am on @CAPS6. Remember what I said, @CAPS6 can lead to life-changing conditions its stopping us from trying to live a healthy life, And @CAPS6 really impacts are body. I recommend you guys read this again.",9
210,"In todays technology filled world, using computers is a growing among us. Everyday computers gather and give endless amount of information like an international school at your home. While many people embrace computers as a much needed things in their abodes, others disagree and compromise. I write to you the local Newspaper for you to agree with me that computers good effects on people. I have three reasons to support this. First it helps increase hand-eye coordination to people who use them. Second, computers give others the ability to gain knowledge on knowing people and places. Lastly computers let people talk to others through computers. Now, I will begin to elaborate. Have you never been a good better at a game of baseball? or been a good passer in basket ball? As surprising as it @MONTH1 seem to the ones who do not know one way to improve hand-eye coordiantion through the usage of computers. Now, just using computers for typing won't grow you the skills to get you @ORGANIZATION1 best these are programs and games that, with today's technology can improve ones hand-eye coordination. For example the army would use computes simulation to train soldiers hand-eye coordination and then mandatory survival skills for when they go to. It is also plausible to any profesional athletes. Computer simulation gives edges and with that go to my next reason. Since now first thought of it, @CAPS1 aid older techniques such s were not reliable. So think computers to get the use need to the for without computers wouldn't know what happen to haiti for. But with computers had fully destroyed the total cost of damageand know help dy. So computers are good when it comes down. Computers are also great for the ability to with through a wide range of programs and websites. This is for because if one websites to speak to friends and family not see them they would still talk one time, my dad even to see relatives but didn't go. Use both computers skype we still stayed. In conclusion computers are great for hand-eye coordination keeping on other countries and staying in to with family or friends.",9
211,"Dear newspaper writer, In the late @NUM1 people had created the @CAPS1 I had studied that lots of People loss eye site, The people became obeised, and enjoying life. Read on and I will explain to you @CAPS3 these @CAPS1 realy effect lots of people. My @CAPS2 reason, @CAPS3 I think that Computers effect people @CAPS8 because people have loss their eyesite from the computers because your eyes caint look at one thing @CAPS14 like three hours. @CAPS14 example doctors had continuesly had told paticants that @CAPS4 you look at a @CAPS5 close you can loose eyesite a @CAPS5 and a @CAPS1 are the same thing because they both can watch @CAPS5 @CAPS6. more and more people will begin to loose their eye site. This needs to stop. My @CAPS7 reason @CAPS8 that lots of people are not enjoying reality because @CAPS1 become addictive because they make new games and websites every month and its hard to stop playing on the @CAPS1. I remember like two months ago they had this new game on @CAPS9 called @CAPS10 @CAPS11 @CAPS12 and you @CAPS27 to play with people from around the world and that game was @CAPS13 but then I was playing the oneday @CAPS14 shops @CAPS15 and dinner and instead I ate @CAPS16 I play my game. I gained @NUM2 pounds that week @CAPS17 I new something wast rite. @CAPS17 I decided not to play on game hangout. that its better being outside then sitting many hours and playing on the @CAPS1 all day. This @CAPS8 @CAPS3 lots of people @CAPS27 @CAPS18 and to help them by banning computers @CAPS14 awhile. My third reason @CAPS8 that people @CAPS27 viriuses! on the Computers or @CAPS19 into the Computers and @CAPS27 all your data like creditcards billing information and even find out where you live. A long time ago I heard that there were alot of viriuses that People had sended to a @CAPS1 and stole all their personal @CAPS20. @CAPS17 @CAPS4 you @CAPS27 a @CAPS1 that's @CAPS22 going to happen and you would have to pay like every month @CAPS23 @CAPS17 that you will prevent viriuses thats alot. This needs to stop all it does @CAPS8 bring @CAPS25 to your Family, This needs to stop. Know @CAPS26 I got your attention I need your help and all the people who does aprove of my opinion need your help support too. These are my three reasons again. One @CAPS8 that people loose their eyesite, @CAPS7 @CAPS8 that lot people aren't enjoying reality and final reason @CAPS8 that people @CAPS27 viriuses on the @CAPS1.",9
212,"Dear: Local Newspaper I think computers are really good for people to use because you can learn a lot about everything. Computers help people on their jobs and in everything it helps kids with there homework and thats really good you can buy stuff using the computer so you won't have to go anywhere. Computers help people pay their bills and stuff using a computer you can check out anything you want to know about or anyplace you want to see and it gives you directions to go places and stuff. Computers help you go to any website and it gives you any information you want or that you need thats really good and when people shop on line is less than if you go to the store thats why a lot of people shop on line because is less money. Kids use computers to play video games with friends and you can talk on the computers with friends and family. Computers are really good help to people because if you want to go anywhere buy anything or pay bills. You can use the computer to do all that stuff. Kids use it to do school work like projects and stuff it helps them save their work so they won't lose anything. People order anything they need thats really cool. Teachers learn something new using the computer and they help kids learn new things. Kids use the computers to go on like @CAPS1 and stuff they can wach music videos talk to friends and play video games. People can even use computers to make music and to cool stuff. People use computers to get music live ituns and videos, movies and games on like an ipod. I think computers are really good they can do anything you want you can go in any website and stuff you can find a lot of information that you need for like a job or school work people should kee using computers they can do anything you need and they help a lot.",8
213,"I not believe computers have a good effect on people. They have bad effects on people and are over used. They are like this for some reasons. They make people spend less time exercising, the outside world, and even time with family and friends so if we keep on using computers like this it will hurt us. Firstly, people are using computers an increasing rate and studies show the more people use computers the less there exercise. And with less people exercising it will add to the problems @CAPS1 @CAPS2 with ability. I would say about half the kids in my school are over weight and when look back pictures of the eight grade from years ago there had half as many obese or over weight students because computers either weren't around or used to much. And statistics show that people to be a lot healtier than those without. So us a result computers are anything but beneficial becomes they mate people less time exercising. Secondly, with people using computer so much they dont enjoy nature as much as they should. Statictics show that people who spend at least a hour outside a day are not only healtier, but here higher test scores. And if less people go outside and enjoy nature, less people will see it significant. For example a recent study shows that @PERCENT1 of people who dont go outside everyday are less to. And that means the more people use the computer the more on earth there is going to be. So as a conclusion computers are not beneficial because they make people spend less time enjoying nature. Lastly, computers take away from time that people can spend with friends and family. It's very important to spend time with family. For example statistics show that of people who are in preson didn't have good relationship with there families. and another study showed that students have @PERCENT2 better grades if they spend at least @NUM1 hours there families a as a computers are not beneficial they time your family. Computers in no way are beneficial could do better things like exercise, enjoy nature or even spend time with love ones. So I urge you do not use computers so much and do other things because.",9
214,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern on the local paper, I firmly believe that computers are the best invention since the telephone and cars! They allow people to stay in touch with the world around them. They even have thousands of typing games and ""how to's"" for you to strengthen your skills. These great inventions allow people to keep in touch in a whole new and much more efficent way. The world isn't like it used to be. People come from all different place around the world and they often forget the most important thing about them, their roots. Not knowing your own culture is like not knowing the other half of you. Luckily, computers have the ability to allow you to find out about your ancestors and what kind of people they were. It also allows you to learn about other cultures in far away places. Suppose you are going on a family trip to @LOCATION1. Wouldn't you want to know the types of clothes they wear, foodds they eat, weather climates, currency? I certenly hope so. How embarrasing would that be not to know any history anout the country you're visiting? As I noted before the world is changing all around us everyday. There are new inventions, government, ideas, statistics, ect just to name a few. I personally think it's truely horrid to deprive people of what is happening in the world around us. Computers can solve this problem in a matter of seconds! People ofteb complain that computers are hard to work or they just don't have the skills to work it. However, there is a solution that millions have overlooked on the internet. Here are hundreds of thousands of games and softwares that enable you to learn any of the skills you could possably need to work a computer. It's truely amazing how rapidly you pick up the skills of hand-eye coordination and typing. These are two extremely important skills every person needs to be successfull in life. And computers offer that to you. I think it is clear that communication is the key to human nature. Computers have multiple ways for people to communicate quickly and efficiently. You can talk with friends, family and work. People often lose friends they used to have due to simple lack of communication. With computers this problem is saved and you are instantly reconnected with them. It is obvios to everyone we are in a bad economy. This means that anyone's job is at stake everyday. If you miss a deadline because you didn't know when it was you can lose your job instantly. However, with computers you can easily ask someone when the due date is. For all my reasons above, I can honestly say that computers are a neccesity in today's world. if you want to lose your culture, connection with people and life long skills, then you'll never get to be successful. Think about it. Do you?",11
215,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS3, @CAPS4's, and @ORGANIZATION2. These are all different brand names for computers. All @ORGANIZATION1 these wonderful divises can help you, the everyday @CAPS5, communicate with people that you would never expect to. You could easily make a friend over in @LOCATION3 or @LOCATION4! @CAPS11 you are writing to your good friend in @LOCATION4, you are using the keyboard to type. If you become experienced enough, like my sister @CAPS6, you can even type without lookindg at the keys. This hand-eye coordination can help you in many things outside @ORGANIZATION1 the computer world. @CAPS10 you come home from school and you have a boat load @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS7 homework, the computer can help you finish that homework and learn about far-away places too. Wouldn't it be wonderful to take a trip to @LOCATION2 and see the @LOCATION1 and the @ORGANIZATION1? With a computer you can go to all @ORGANIZATION1 those places without leaving the comfort @ORGANIZATION1 your home. @CAPS10 you, reader are reading about @LOCATION4, you will find out that they have different views on what is sociallly acceptible and what isn't. @CAPS10 and if you go to @LOCATION4, you can already be ahead @ORGANIZATION1 the curve. How annoying would it be to get all A's on your report card except for that one lousy @CAPS8 on in @CAPS7? It would be terrible right? Well no more. One out @ORGANIZATION1 every four people who do their homework with the aid @ORGANIZATION1 the computer get better scores on quizes and tests. What about talking to your friends @CAPS11 you are doing your homework to ask them a question; wouldn't that be great? I love my camp friends. I love them more than my own siblings, but I don't get to talk to them much during the year. With computers that all changed. I know that some people think that kids should go outside more and be with their family lets get realistic,what family wants their teen around anyway? They are moody and unplesent. ""@CAPS10 my child will have a homework question,"" my mother says. ""I would want them to have the flexability to e-mail their teacher and ask them."" @CAPS11 all @ORGANIZATION1 your children are type, type, typing away they are learning valuable hand-eye coordination. Baseball, tennis, football, lacross and many other sports require a mountain @ORGANIZATION1 hand-eye coordination. Catching a ball or hitting it requires a lot @ORGANIZATION1 skill and practice and that is wear typing comes handy. I am sure you know this reader, but most teens can type without looking down to see what they are doing. Some people think that they, teens, are just being lazy and not getting enough exersize, but with the boat-load @ORGANIZATION1 homeworks, how can they. (That is a whole another story.) @CAPS12, @CAPS12, @CAPS12. That is the sound @ORGANIZATION1 letters being pushed down on the keyboard @ORGANIZATION1 computers everywhere. It is also the sound @ORGANIZATION1 communication. The sound @ORGANIZATION1 the world becoming one continent instead @ORGANIZATION1 seven. It is the sound @ORGANIZATION1 learning about other people's culture and what is important to other people. It is the sound @ORGANIZATION1 hand-eye coordination that will make the next @CAPS13 @PERSON2 or the next @PERSON1. It is the sound, dear readers, @ORGANIZATION1 learning.",10
216,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern, I am writing this letter to inform you on my opinion, on the effects computers have on people. I do not agree with the idea of computers because, people spend way too much time on them. Some people aren't who they say they are (which creates a danger zone for many!) @CAPS1 there are many who @MONTH1 go on the computer for inappropiate matters. Hopefully by the end of this letter, you will very much agree with me. My first reason of thinking is because, people spend way too much time on computers. Which could get in the way of reality with them. Enstead of going outside for a walk or even to play... people are rushing home for what? Computers. Enstead of going home to do homework students rush to go on the computer. The computer can and will distract people from their responsibilities. Before you know it, your whole life will resolve around computers. Then there's people who complain about their weight! So go on and excerise, go outside and be active! But no... they go and go on the computer. When just sitting there, and gaining wait without even knowing. Secondly, some people don't stick with their true identity. They're not who they say they are! And this is a major problem, exspecially with chat rooms. It creates a danger zone for all, exspecially with young kids. Someone could lie and say they're your age... but they're not! Then try to become your friend, and before you know it they wana meet you in person! But what for? Most people dont think about that, they're just so happy & excited they got a new friend. Or this new guy that says he's your age and always complementing you. Before you even know it you become the person all over the news and newspaper known as ""@CAPS2"". Finally, there are many people who go on the computer for a more inappropriate things! This can become a problome with young kids and grownups. Same for nute pictures and even some for poronogrephy. Some are ""under age"" and some are ""overage"". Either way, thats just discousting to me! These kind of things shouldn't even be allowed on the computer at all. And people who have an addiction to these kind of things, the computer won't help... its just feeding them... making them worse. In conclution, now you have read and hopefully understand my reason of thought. Because of how much time people spend on it, some people aren't who they say they are, and @CAPS1 using and abusing the computer for inappropriate reasons.",9
217,"Hey! Do you like computers? I understand the issue about what effects computers have on people. I think computers help people educational and socially.

They all are very kind people. Some are fun to talk to and others are fun to play games with online, like checkers. Computers can teach you maty things, Computers can teach people many cultures and about different countries. Without computers some people probably won't know as much about other countries or cultures. Computers also teach us about history. If there are no computers we probably won't learn as' much about history as you do in school. Computers help people educaionally. Don't you want a good education? computers teach us math. Soical studies, and many more subjects. I think computers are very helpful. Computers help you make new friends, computers can teach you many things, and computers help people educationally.

218,"Whats your opinion on how computers affect peoples lives? I agree that it really does affect our lives for thse three reasons they start to gain alot of weight. they don't go outside as much, and they dont spend alot of time with there family. If people spend all there time being on the computer they'll gain alot of weight then wonder why. Its because they don't get out the house and excercise enough or maybe not at all. For example my dad use to do that all the time, they one day he realized he was gaining alot of weight. So what did he do, he started to work out alot more. He's still on the computer all the time but he excercises in between. Us humans need fresh air come in a while. For our bodies to function the way there suppose to. But how is that suppose to happen if you stay at home on the computer and don't go outside. I ounce heard on to that if your body doesnt get the fresh air that it needs that you'll get used to the costaphobic air in your house. That's not good either. You'll probaly start to forget what day it is, what month cause you spend your time on the computer all day."" @CAPS1 my mother. If you spend all of your time worring about myspace. @CAPS2, and aim you'll forget about the important things in your life. Your family. I think is way better than myspace, @CAPS2, and aim. ""I say cause you could get tired of all those things but you never get tired of your family. Your family will start to fell that the computer is way better then them and it shouldn't be that way. Spend time with your family go places with them parly. Play board games with them. Cause remember you can replace. Myspace, @CAPS2, and aim but you cant replace the people that love you and care for you which is your family. In conclusion you should think about it. If you agree with my three reasons you start to gain weight, don't get enough fresh air, and don't send alot of time with your family. But after your done reading my essay i hope you change your mind and agree with me. Your life is way more important than being on the computer all day.",8
219,"Dear local newspaper, Computers have a big role in our daily lifes. They are important and we leave it to them to do a lot of our work for us. Ther is such thing as being smart about using your computer. There is also over abusing the time we spend on it. But computers can't be taken away from us, we just got to use them wisely, and these are some of my reasons @CAPS1 reason I think we are affected by computers is because it actually helps out our environment. Going on the computer to do work. And it also alows us to pay our bills. This is a big ordeal. If we use computers more to do this stuff we will help out our environment by not using as much paper. Just imagine, people won't need to worry about wild life as much just because of a computers? Well, yeah it is just doing bad for us if we are on it @NUM1 but im pretty sure if we limit our time from the computer we will make a change! Secondly, in school or at our jobs we might get a book that was published in @DATE2. It is now a new century, and not everything is up to date. Computers always have the latest news. I believe they will now only help us with the knowledge over @DATE1. But computers will inform us on not just whats going on in our state but whats going around the world today. They help us and reminds us on now. We should change and make our world a better place. Lastly, I think computers are a important thing because we don't only see whats going on with people and stuff, but we can also interact with them. As kids we like to meet new people and over the computer is a great way. This can help us practise communicating with people. As long as youre not on it @NUM1. But we are teenagers what do you expect. teens are all down for meeting now people. As long as we are safe with it. That is another reasong I think computers help us. I think computers are a possitive way to help our environment. Thank you for taking the time to hear my side.",8
220,These are reasons people should support advances in technology computers are good way to keep in touch with friends that move or family that live for away. In the current job market you have to learn how to work a computer. Computers are very useful if you know how to use it correctly. When it comes down to it. It's their choice. Wether they go out to play or stay inside. You can say anything you want to people if they don't want to something they're hot going to. Those were my reasons.,4
221,"Dear newspaper writers, Have you ever used a computer and learned of a way that it improves your day and makes life more interesting? Well, if you have, then you have had a taste of how computers benefit society. I use a computer to help me keep track of which of my favorite producs are being made and i can even watch my favorite shows on the computer. Computers can also help inother ways beyond watching shows and finding out about newly released iems. For instance, they teach hand-eye coordination every time you use the mouse. also, plenty of websites give information about faraway places and other people, and i bet you guys use almost @NUM1 of those websites. Lastly, communication on the web is a major part of people's lives. Just read on, and i'll tell you more about the wonder of computers! First of all, hand-eye coordination improvement is a major issue with computers.I used to have little to no coordination, but now, after using computers, I can use my sense of touch and sight to do anything, even with my bad hand. You must it forget all of the helpful and even fun computer programs made for the sake of teaching coordination. I remember a program hat tought me how to easily type letters on the computer without moving my hand around. I only know of two other hand-eye coordination exercises, and they are playing difficult video games for hours and hours and boring physical exercises that don't really help. So, basically, computers are the best way to help your eyes and hands work together. Also, if you want, you can search for info about faraway places such as @LOCATION1, and people such as the man who invented the sandwitch. For example, i recall a time when i had to make a poster for @PERSON1, and i searched on the internet for a icture and information about him, as well as where his @DATE1 championship took place. There also a program called @ORGANIZATION1 which someone to se every inch of our planet. @PERCENT1 of americans use the computer to get their information on people and places. There are some pieces of information that are found on the computer that can't be found in a book. These are some of the reasons that a computer is the best place to get information. Lastly, communication on a computer is fun, and sometimes a necessity. This reminds me of a time when i wrote a letter on the internet to my favorite company about the upcoming robocop movie, and they actually responded to my letter. There is a website called myspace.com which is used for introducing people to other people. There have been instances of communication over the web where people would be hunted or killed after telling the stalker their name and adress, and that is why new privacy systems are made all the time. Before i forget, there are two computer games made for socializing and having fun at the sametime: @CAPS1 of warcraft and second life. Communicating on the internet doesn't just benefit society, it connects it, too. I hope that this letter better helps you understand how important computers are to society. Computers have special ways of helping people learn hand-eye coordination. Information is easily found and in great quantities on the internet. Lastly, the web brings thousands of people together almost everyday. The computer actually helps people live their lives. If they were bad, @PERSON2 wouldn't still make them. Please, make the right decision and support computers the way i do.",11
222,"Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 the computer have too much of an impact on our lives? I don't think it @CAPS2, because it is used for so many good causes. One of them is that you can learn things about places you have never heard of. Another one is that you can interact with other people. Also, you can do some online shopping. Beleive it or not the computer isn't all games and facebook. There are other websited that you can learn about things on place and religions that you have never even heard of. Also there are other websited that people write article that tell us about current wars. Other websites can tell us news about celebrities, terrerists, and the presidednt. I know that the computer has a possitive effect on people. Next we have interaction, with the use of a computer you can interact with people from your school, friends, or even cousins. We can do this because we have webcams and internet sites that let you talk to your friends. I know I'm on the computer and I video chat with my cousins and friends. It helps make plans and keep in contact with your family or friends. Also their is a microphone that will let you talk to other people! Trust me computers definetly have a possitive effect on people. We can also use the computer to go shopping. Like I know stop and shop has a peapod delivery system, because say you are really sick or you are elderly and you don't want to come out of the house today you can just go online and pick out your food. Also there is a lot of online book stores, say you really wan't this one book but your local book store doesn't have it you can order it online. Also there are just some essential house goods that any store around doesn't have, you can go online and buy them. And last but not least, clothes. Say you are walking through some stores and you find this beautiful top but you don't have enough money to buy it, you can always go online and find the shirt and it migt be cheaper. The computer has so much possitive effects on today life. So, @CAPS2 the computer have a good effect on life today? Yes! We could go shopping. We could learn about current events that are happening today. Also, we can communicate with others. The computer doesn't just have a possitive effect but it also fun. Now you can go and make a bette decision on if the computer has possitive or negative effects on people. ",9
223,"Dear newspaper editor, @CAPS1, @CAPS2 name is @CAPS3 and I think computers are a great thing. Three reasons why I think this are: you can learn, people can communicate, and they very fun to use. Hopefully by the time you finish reading, you will also think computers are great and have good effects. While visiting places is great, learning about places is even better. Anyone can surf the web and find tons of facts about anything. Say you wanted to go to @LOCATION1 but your budget was tight. Use the web. There are tons of videos, facts, pictures, and other things on @ORGANIZATION1 world. You still @MONTH1 not be able to ride rides or play games there, but at least you can get a good feeling about @ORGANIZATION1. Also, anyone can learn about other countries! Millions of facts on any country or state no matter where it is. You could even talk with people from around the world, which brings as to @CAPS2 next point. Communication is key. Especially in this day, it is very important to talk and socialize. There are many messaging systems that can be used to communicate. AIM, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and @ORGANIZATION2 are just few of e-mail and instant messaging systems. It @MONTH1 take days to get mail to other countries via air-mail. But with e-mail, messages are sent in mere seconds. Also, video chatting is on the rise. If you can't visit someone, then talk through video. You can see and hear each other the entire time. Even though they are almost @NUM1 miles or more away, you can still meet them face-to-face. Boy, all this computer talk sure is fun. Seriously though, computers are very fun. You can go onto game sites or play solitare or even pinball. No more going out to the arcade and spending your parents pay checks. The games are free (depending which website) and, for the most part, fun. But wait, there's more! Are you older and don't like video games and other games? Then watch videos. Need on update on the news but it is long before @LOCATION2 news is on? Then go to a news website. YouTube is also great for videos. Funny, sad, or dramas are all part of the ""tube"" community. So have fun and keep your wallets full. Well, I have told you three reasons why computers are good and have great effects on people. If you still aren't buying it, then get this last reason: the price. As I talked about in previous segments, the cost is low. If you keep the computer well maintained, you can get great things out of it. Some computers can get very high in price, but the average is low. Around @MONEY1 to @MONEY2 on average. So you see, computers are great and have very good effects on people. If you don't believe me, then go out and try one yourself. I am sure you will love it.",10
224,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 was come to my attention that, although computers are helpful, some people believe are taking more from society than giving. I disagree with this statement. Computers teach hand-eye coordination, help us learn, and allow us to talk to others. Computers are quite helpful to the modern person. Computers allow us to develope many skills at an early age. Many games are now made for computers to help teach small children hand-eye coordination. The games @MONTH1 include hitting a ball in virtual baseball to using a hammer and nails virtually. Many experts say children that develope these skills online are more capable on the real world. In fact studies have shown over @PERCENT1 of children that play educational games exibet well developed, fine motor skills at an early age. This could mean that soon the young people of society will learn faster in sports and develope an interest in playing games outside. While young children are developing motor skills teens and adults are reasearching. Many teens use the internet as reasource, I know I do. Teens often must do reports for multiple classes. Not many students have the time to go to the also they are reasearching or. We are often being with sports, younger siblings or but the internet is! Most teens prefer the orignal program will. They find @CAPS2 and you can buy many online now. This saves, to power machines to the. The human millions calling down to which. We could of their. Humans @CAPS3 and the internet will help the. The internet also allows people to talk to one another. This allows people to share pictures, opinions and assignments. Many adult like @NUM1 share pictures of when they were younger with friends and family. By converting pixels into @CAPS4 you can e-mail, @CAPS5 @CAPS6 or share via so web-page. Opinions are also shared. Many people have discussions over issues they feel are pressing, such as the rain forest or fossil fuels. Many people pursuade others this way, or form groups about this concern. Teens also use the internet for school work. If student forgets some thing they can ask a friend to fax @CAPS2 over or remind them what page the assignment was on. This is very helpful because if prevents failing grades and bad report cards. I hope my letter has informed you about the many ways computers are helpful. They teach hand-eye coordination, help us learn about the world around us, and allow people to talk about important issues.",10
225,"Dear, to whom it @MONTH1 concern I have @NUM1 different but similar opinion on how computers can effect people. One opinion is that they can help you trying to find things on the computer. Second reason is because you can enhance your hand-eye cordination and my last reason is that you can learn new thinks by playing educational games. My reason us that they can help you find thing that you and not know about and they can help you because if you have a biography report you have to do for school and they dont have a book on that person you can look it upon the computer the give you so many sorces to choose from but if you did the book only gives you one resource to choose from. My second reason for how computers effect people is that it gives them hand eye cordination which you really need in anyway which can help uou later in hand eye cordination is a great reason is become you will be able to computer same time. My last reason how computer effect people is that they can off how to get know it there website were you are such in subject our doing help you grom so that you can become better and get good grades on test. In conclusion I think that computers have a great effect on people from the reasons listed above which were help you learn something secondly enhane hand eye cordination and to get a better education. I hope this help you alot and you agreed to it",7
226,"Dear @PERSON1 @CAPS1, In the computer beneficial controversy I am standing @CAPS2 computer. People of all ages use these machines. The majorally for reasons benefiting them many very from kids just old enough to read to the just forgeting new. Many parents wonder nowadays whether sites should be enough to let their socialize and civilice on them. But the majority of childrens sites and cd-rom games are their young minds to adapt early to a world filled with knowledge and learning. Childen can learn oh so another reason to be @CAPS2-computers is because people of any age cn hop on the old internet and a journey of learning ! New people, new culture, anything like. a moments passing you could have all the information you could went at your fingertips. Who could ever think to try to live without their social networking site? Sites such as facebook, myspace, @MONTH1 have their down falls but they are great texts for connecting distant. former class co-workers even catching up with old friends. So before you think about putting computers consider the good also. There is so much more. Thank you.",7
227,"Dear local Newspaper, Computers have a possitive effect on people. Firstly, you learn new information using the @CAPS1. @CAPS12, you can use the computer to communicate with other people. Finally, you usually find work using a computer. First of all computers have a positive effect on people because people can use the computer to learn new information. Firstly, there are web sites on the computer that post informative articles on the @CAPS1. @CAPS7 you want to learn something new about the world or just about anything else you can look on the computer. @CAPS12, @CAPS7 you are looking for information for just one subject, you can easily find that too. For examples, a web site like @CAPS2 @CAPS3 just has you type in a subject and it finds articles about it for you. Lastly you can probably learn something by just searching on the web. Professor @PERSON1 of @CAPS4 @CAPS1 @CAPS6 says, ""@CAPS7 you spend just five minutes looking through the @CAPS1 chances are you will learn something new."" Computers have a possitive effect on peope beacuse they can learn new information. @CAPS12, computers have a possitive effect on people because you can use the computer to communicate with other people. Firstly, you can be in a @CAPS10 room with anyone around the world in one of these @CAPS10 @CAPS11. Doctor @PERSON2 of @CAPS8 @CAPS1 use of @CAPS10 @CAPS11 says ""oproximatly one million people from all around the world log on to @CAPS10 @CAPS11 everyday to talk to other people."" @CAPS12, you can use the computer to write a letter or type literature. For example, you are writing an important letter to your friend, but your pen or pencil break. You can type it on the computer instead. Lastly, @CAPS7 you have something important (anything) and you want share it with the world, all you have to do is use the computer to make a web site. In a resent study on overage every web site on the @CAPS1 is viewed at least twice a day, many people are bounded to see your web site. Lastly, computer have a possitive effect on people because you can easily find work using a separate. Firstly, you can find job lists or companies offering jobs on the computer. For example you just got fired from a job its not for bad because you can just find another job online. @CAPS12, some people get paid by typing or posting things on the computer. in a recent study @PERCENT1 of jobs today involve working on a computer. Lastly, you can stay a home while you work on the computer. Learning new information on the computer, communicating through the computer, and using the computer to find work are all reasons why computer have a possitive effect on people. Millions of people use the computer everyday, would you, the local newspaper, want to tell them it is not good for them?",11
228,"Dear @CAPS1, (Local Newspaper) I believe that computers have far more negative effects on people than their positive effects. One major problem w/ computers is that they could make their users spend less time w/ family. Also, they could arise in an addiction, ( to the comp.) @CAPS2, there are quite more ""productive"" things to do instead of being on the computer. Family is a very important factor in life, along w/ friends. We all need family & friends to spend time with. The time we spend w/ family & friends should be thought of as precious because they won't always be around. So, why waste this time on the computer when it could be spent w/ the ones you love? When you go on the comp. for a while your friends & family are probably missing hanging out w/ you or just having you there. My mother only allows me to go on the computer for @NUM1 hour, at most, each day. She says that is so I can spend time w/ herself & my family. She is right because we only have them for so long so we should use that to our advantage. This leads me into my next topic. An addiction is something that you live, breathe & can't live w/o. Usually addictions are bad. An addiction that is getting worse in people throughout the years is a computer addiction. @CAPS3. @PERSON1 says ""A recent study shows the @PERCENT1 of teens spend more than @NUM2 hours a day on the computer & of that, @PERCENT2 were just recently diagnosed w/ an addiction. This is bad, real bad."" @CAPS3 @PERSON1 is right. This is real bad. It needs to be stopped. I talked to a counciler the other day. She has about @NUM3 different people came to her a month & about @NUM4 of them are computer addicts! It @MONTH1 not seem like alot now, but @CAPS4 we don't stop this than soon the numbers & statistics will get out of control. Now, nobody wants that, do they? Also, being on the comp. far too long could result in eyesight problems, because you are staring @ the screen too long. To stop the rapidly increasing numbers of people who spend too much time on the computer we need to influence the people positively w/ healthier things to do. There are many other ""healthy alternatives"" to computers. You could go & exercise, or just hang w/ friends. My mom said to me once ""@CAPS4 you do healthier things now, it will definately help you in the long run."" I know it @MONTH1 sound dumb to kids, but it is true. Comps. also have an unhealthy influnce on kids because of the internet. Many things are innapproiate for young users, but they are not blocked. For example! AIM, people can say anything. Sure comps. are of great convinence, but life is not about convinence all the time. We need to relize that people could be spending more time w/ family + friends, we could have less addicts & that there are healthier alternatives to computers. So please would you help. We need to make this world a better place, this is a small step.",11
229,"Dear newspaper writer's, I think that computer's are not so bad. I think the time you should use a computer is in the @DATE1 and be outside in the @DATE2. Computer's are good because you can learn many things about different country's diffent equipment and technology and about the kind. You also can stay in contact with all you friends, send pictures and letter's to your friend's that live in different countrie's and state's. They could also help with your school work and projects. The outdoor's is very important to people. You need to get fresh air and get excercise. You need to stay active to stay healthy. Nobody like's sitting in the house all day. That is no fun. People should play an hour a day. I really don't see why people wouldn't want to, it is fun to be outside. People need computers though. It help's with there work, balancing money and putting information on it. It also help's with organizing their week like planner. It can tell people time day of the month and people in their life. Computer's are very handy to daily life and work. That is why computer's are important to every day life but make sure you get some fresh air and computer's are helpful to society.",7
230,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 is an argument going around debating whether computers benefit society, or whether they will destiny it. I think that computers have a negative and a positive side and shouldnt @CAPS2 people need to learn to divide @CAPS1 time so that they can excersize and use the computer in moderation. The @CAPS3 to having a computer one being that people will be able to talk with friends & family that do not live close to you. This would be a pro, or positive point, because if one were to completely stop communication over the internet some families will have no way to talk to one another. @CAPS2 if someone had a friend in @LOCATION2 and were suddenly forced to move to @LOCATION1 people would have a difficult time comminucating through because @LOCATION1 is @NUM1 hours behind so when it is @NUM1 oclock @CAPS4 @CAPS1, here it is @NUM3 oclock so most kids would be in school. Another pro would be that a lot of learning for children, the computer whether it be in of all of school. For example I have a @NUM4 year old cousin and she learns the alphabet and much @CAPS1 so the computer such as math, and some language were to stop using computers in one community of children will not be as The would be computers increase hand eye coordination. For example when children are brought to the want to teach hand-eye coordination and linked their babys that learning will be better at sports. The cons, or negative points, would be one is people are spending to much time on the computer and not excersizing. And a survey was taken at an obeisity clinic and @PERCENT1 of these people stated that when they should've been excersizing they were on the computer. Second is that families that live together are spending time on the computer instead of spending time together, this is destroying some families and even some friendships. People need to learn that computers have their pros and their cons. And that a person can't live their life on the computer or, in other words, computer's are good and bad. People just need to learn how to use them in moderation with everything society (outside of the computer) in their life.",8
231,"Dear editor: I am writing on behalf of my fellow students as well as teachers. Once you finish reading this letter, I am confident you will agree that having computers can be a serious benefit. Three reasons I say this areas follows: increased work productivity, easier reasearch, and more learning within a household. My first reason for writing you is that on in home computer can increase work productivity. I remember a time when I had to write and I just could not get started. So I asked my mom if I could do it on the computer, and e-mail it to my teacher. She said yes and I worked on the paper using microsoft word. To make a long story short, I finished the paper in @NUM1 hour. So as you can see from my example, having a computer increases work productivity in most people. The second reason that having an in home computer is a benefit if easier research. Reasearch can be extremely hard when you work at a library. But with a computer, you can find information in a few minutes that would take hours to find at a library. Also the internet has no weight, so you could carry books worth of information in your laptop as it would never get any heavier. Also, the internet will exist as long as there are computers to access it, a will and rot. So as you can see, reasearch the computer can be a breeze. The third reason having a computer is helpful is that it can increase the pace at learning. Learning can be increased when information and work are official statistics of people learn faster a computer. So as it is clear to me as it probably is to you, having a computer can make learning easier. I hope how I have convinced you that owning a computer is a huge benefit.",8
232,"I believe that the effects computers have on people is bad. One reason is that if you spend too much time on a computer you could have a bad posture from leaning over. Next, the computer keeps people from going outside and getting exercise. Lastly, the computer keeps people from doing things they need to do. You could have a bad posture from leaning over too much. When you are on a computer you want to be as close to it as you can, so you would hunch over to get a better view. When you are typing you would lean to see what you are writing. If you are on the computer hunched over too much it would become a habbit to always lean over, especialy when you walk. The computer can keep people from getting exercise and going outside. most children would go on the computer when they get home, instead of going outside to play. The computer has so many things to do or it wich temps children to go on all the time. It is one of the main causes that a large percentage of kids are overweight in the @LOCATION1. The computer keeps people from doing necessary things they need to do. A lot of kids will not do their homework because of the exercise time spent on the computer. People procrastinate either communicating with friends, playing a game or even shopping online wich is a major factor from doing important things. If there was no computer people would not be as tempted, therfore they would get on with their life and complete things that have to get done. The computer has a bad and unecessary effect on people. it gives people a bad posture keeps them from getting exercise and going outside. It also keeps people from doing things they to do. The computer is one of the main forters in children and also adults being overweight. Therfore the computer has bad impacts on people in society.",8
233,"Computers are one of the most popular electronics; they can almost do anything! And along with that they also have a positive effect on people. Computers give people the ability to learn about far away places, allow people to talk online, and even teach hand-eye coordination. They must affect people in a positive way considering everything they can do for us! When money's tight, and you don't have the time to travel. Where do you go to learn about new, but far away places? Most would go to the library, but why go when you could easily find articles within seconds rather than scan books for hours? The internet on the computer provides researches with millions of resources-much more than most libraries. Without lifting a finger, but instead a few clicks of a mouse you can find reliable articles and photographs from scientbists; or even basic description of areas from hotels. In other words, you can practically travel while staying in your computer seat! The ability to learn about far away places is enhanced in many ways just by logging on to the computer, which definitely has a positive effect on people. The computer isn't justb convenient for learning but also for talking! Overtime, many instant messaging systems have been created and risen to extreme fame, making it easy to stay in touch with old friend and distant relatives, its fast, and rather than burn up minnutes on a telephone, typing into most chatting programs is free. In addition, you can send files of any kind-music, pictures, documents-allowing computer users to get critical feedback on their work, or sharing interesting things in a way much more easily done than the telephone. Chating get the computer is just another way the computer has a positive on people. Lastly, yet interesting enough the computer touches hand-eye coordination. The actual holding of the mouse and the interaction with the observing of it on-screen benefits hand-eye coordination. Obviously this can help athletes (eith the night programming of course), but also ordinary people, our hands and eyes interact with almost every movement we make, so why deny the chance to improve? Computers not only have a positive effect on people, but more specifically their hand-eye coordination, too. The effect computers have on people has been under observation for years now, but despite the pessimistic opinions of others, it certainly does have a positive effect. COmputers are machines that, along with helping us learn, talk, and with hand-eye coordination, have a positive effect on people. They truly benefit us in more ways than we can count.",11
234,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 the controversy over wehther computers have a negative or positive affect on society heats up, I feel the need to express my well thought out opinion to enlighten the public. There is no doubt in my mind that this rapidly growing technology can make the entire @CAPS6 a better place. Utilizing access to the internet opens a whole new door of possibilities reading the quest for knowledge. Perhaps even more importantly, online programs such @CAPS3 @CAPS4, email, and @CAPS5 can using friends closer together strengthing there companionship so that it lasts a lifetime. Finally, the best part about computers is that they make the @CAPS6 smaller in theory, so that a conversation with your mom in @LOCATION1 is one click away. Although few people will admit it, the thirst for knowledge is one of the strongest human instincts and it shall never be quenched. Thanks to computers, it doesn't have to be. What would have taken of reading and searching to find a single answer a century ago, can now be done with the click a mouse on google. Knowing too much can never be a bad thing. I'm not that every person who has used used a computer is smarter than someone who hasn't, but I will say that proper utilization of this technology drastically increases the actual potential to learn. One of the classic arguements of someone who is anti-computers is that it diminishs your social life dramiticly. On the contrary, the social life of someone who often uses the computer is almost always going to be more prosperous. Online you can chat with friends about whatever you want. You can even chat with a group multiplying your friends, and since when is having to many friends a bad thing. Not only will you meet and make new friends, but these technological advancements will even furthur strengthen the that you share with your best friends, expanding the life span of these friendships to after college. When you have internet, there is no such thing @CAPS3 long-distance relationships because everybodies a click away. The @CAPS6 @CAPS7 web does just what the name implies. I connects the whole planet bringing families and cultures closer together. Just the other day I watched @CAPS3 a friend of mine with his grandmother in @ORGANIZATION1 through a video chat. Family members that would otherwise never meet are coming together thanks to computers. Cultures are also spreading around the @CAPS6 because of this advancement. Now that there are computers, the @CAPS6 is shrinking to a comfortable and convienient size. Computers will change not millions, but billions of lives for the better. Human beings will continue to develop stronger bads with fellow people @CAPS3 the @CAPS6 gets smaller. Having to really search to gain knowledge will be a thing in the past. Technology is the key to making our @CAPS6 a better place.",10

Computers help keep people @CAPS6 to date on the local @CAPS11 and/or weather alerts. They also let people from any place at any time commnicate. Finally a computer also has many cool apps at your disposale. I dont know about you but my parents never know whats happening in the world or even in their own town. When they got a computer it allowed them to learn about the latest @CAPS11 whenever they want. They learned about new things @CAPS1 @PERSON2 is doing to help the @LOCATION2. They also learned that @LOCATION1 won the gold medal in hockey @CAPS3 the @DATE1 winter olympics. Finally they were updated that a big storm was coming and to stay indoors. Thank goodness @CAPS3 that. Other people can learn new things about the world and more like communicating with friends. Did I say friends? I ment to say that a computer can also let you talk online with friends, family and just about anybody else who owns a computer. @CAPS3 people who dont have a home phone and can't afford a cell phone you can talk on the computer. Whether it be by email or I.m. Talking about I.ming if you have some urgent information that you have to tell someone immedetly then you can just @CAPS2 people. (@CAPS3 you older folks out there I.m means instant messeging.) @CAPS4 course anybody can make an email address as well and just talk to people using that too! A computer is a great way to communiate, learn, and it has lots @CAPS4 cool stuff to use. It's true a computer does have lots @CAPS4 cool and suprising tools or apps @CAPS3 you to use. A piece @CAPS4 software called ""@CAPS5 @CAPS6"" is easy to use and nice to have. ""@CAPS5 @CAPS6"" allows you to build and design houses, buildings and just about anything @NUM1-@CAPS9 online. I think thats awsome. We cant forget the magnifisent internet. One @CAPS4 the best inventions @CAPS4 man kind. The internet lets people look @CAPS6 anything from dinosaurs to the revelotionary war to @PERSON1. The interent is a place where you can learn stuff, teach stuff, post stuff and more! A computer has very complex things like @CAPS5 @CAPS6 and the internet but it also has simple accessories too. Like a calculator, a clock or even a virtual sticky note pad to write (I mean type) notes on. So dear local newspaper, thanks @CAPS3 taking the time to read my letter and understand that a computer teaches people a lot through the internet, allows people to talk to there friends whenever they want and finally it keeps people like my parents @CAPS6 to date on the @CAPS11 @CAPS4 the world. P.S. @CAPS4 course a computer will never get the cool, importat @CAPS11 that you local newspaper do!",9
236,"Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I beleive that computers have a positive effect on society. By using a computer you are able to improve your hand eye coordination, give others helpful information about far away people + places, you also are able to talk online @NUM1, send others pic, documents, videos, or just post them on a webpage. I think that computers are vital when it comes to improving our nation. Did you know that computers can offer rehab or just extra help for those in need. By using a computer you are able to improve your hand eye coordiation, or play learing games. Using a computer you are able to improve your hand eye coordiation because in order to click on things you must look at the button with your eyes and click on it with your hand. @CAPS6 is also computer softwares available that helps people learn. By using a computer we are capable of learning things about far away people and places. This is very useful because it enables people to become educated no matter where you are in the world. Using a computer does not cost much if you do not own one. Enyone can go for free. This is very helpful. By using a computer you are esily able to share your pic, documents, and videos. It is as easy as as few simple clicks, you can privatly send mesages to your friends using @CAPS3 or e-mail. OR you could post them on @CAPS4 or @CAPS5 sites. This is very useful in the fact that if you ever needed to reach someone in case of emergency you would be able to. Because of all of these reasons and more saying that computers are nessisary in the sense taht they are helpful, useful, and can improve our society for the better. Even though computers are wonderful you should always exercize everyday no matter what. USE COMPUTERS - @CAPS6 @CAPS7!",8
237,Dear @CAPS1 I think that computers are good for this world because it lets people talk to other people around the world and to do important work. Another reason is that you can learn faraway places and you could learn about famous people and how they live and what they do for a living. If you need to do a project just go on a computer and look up what ever you need t due you project. If your bord and there nothing to do you could go and play some games or look up stuff. I know that computer can upset people because all of that technology and that computer playing video game and talking to friends then speding time outside and playing games outside and to explore nature.,6
238,Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 opinion on the effects computers have on other people are that... Well it's true that a lot of people do spend to much time on the computer but is that neceserily a realy bad thing. For instance what if you're in college and you have to write or type like a @NUM1 page essay on @LOCATION1. You hardly know anything on @LOCATION1. You have to spend most of the day on the computer researching about @LOCATION1 and it's history and typing it down. Do you think thats a wast of time don't you want to pass and have to redo the class agian. I know some other people don't use there computers like. Others use there computers to talk to people online. Like on myspace or facebook you might think thats a wast of time too but what if your walking around your town one day and see someone you were talking to on myspace your intrdouce yourself and then you guys become friends. What i'm trying say is computers aren't that bad.,6
239,"The world is slowly becoming smaller and smaller. Not litteraly of course instead people are given the oportunity to learn, communicate and study other cultures. @CAPS2 would not be able to do this without computers. Computers help people because they teach hand-eye coordination, they give people the chance to learn and comunicate with foreign cultures, and they help the world technoligicly progess. Computers teach hand-eye coordination. This is an extremely important skill to have in today's world. @CAPS2 must be able to type fast and precise to suceed from day to day. Afterall who wants an unifitiont, un-coordinated person as their buisness partner. Every time I go to school I realize something new has been upgraded or made technological, and us @NUM1 graders are expected to be able to figure out programs. Not only do computers help @CAPS1 succeed, it also helps children in poor countries to comunicate with the outside world. Computers help mankind because it gives children and adults rich or poor to communicate with other cultures. By doing this @CAPS2 are opening up whole to paths for every day children to branch out and find a productive career. It also teaches kids to be tolerant of diffrent ethnicities at an early age. Some people might say that computers are bad because they expose children to violence and poverty in other countries. However is that really a bad thing? All children eventually learn that there is more to life then their town so why is it bad to teach kids to be aware of dangers at a young age. A wise man once said, ""@CAPS2 have history @CAPS2 don't repeat ourselves"". Well that is exactly what @CAPS2 would be doing if @CAPS2 stop using computers. people would stay in their own town have no usterstanding of the outside world and live a mediocre life. is that the life you would want to be living? Computers take us for and beyond the limitations of man kind and they will stay that way. The future is now. It is time for exploration and advancement. Computers make this possible by giving people opportunities to advance, etc mans are born to suceed, so why settle for any thing less? ",9
240,"Dear local Newspaper, I am writting to persuade you to belive that computes are good to have. Three reasons are they are helpfull. They are fun and they are good for people. First of all they are very helpfull. They are mhelpfull because you can learn about different places. For example you can learn about @CAPS1 earthquake if you don't have t.v. You can learn about @CAPS2 and what to do to help if you want. Another example, is that you can learn about people in far away places. For example, you can learn why people in africa there faces and put bones through there noses or lips. My last example is that it helps us under stand anything we want. For example you can learn how to do malgebra, or how to make . You can understand anything you won't if you go on a computer. Secondly, they are really fun. They are fun because you can play all sorts of games. For example you can play games mean games, games that suites you, you can even create. Another reason they are fun is that you can talk to people can by twitter. E-mail, aim, myspace, facebook and many different other ways. My last examples is that you can download and even print pictures. You can print pictures of any thing. For example you can print pictures or your best friend movie , animals and more things. Thirdly, computers can be good for you. They can be good for you by you can meet new people, you can get a new boyfriend, you can make new friends. For example if you are looking for a new boy friend or girl friend you can go on e-harmony. Lets date.com and many different websites. Another example uis that if you to promote your company or buisnes you can craete your own website. For example, my neighbor created a website for his buisness and now he is putting more buildings up all around the world. My last reason is that you ca skype this is good for you because if you have a family member that lives faraway you can use a skype can era to talk to each other even though you really far away. Those are my @NUM1 reasons why computers are good they can help, they are good, and they are fun.",8
241,"Dear computer technology I think computers have a positive effect on people because computers tell you information that you need. Computers are good because it gives tips on which you wanna learn about. Also two years ago @PERSON1 a member of the computer company said, about @NUM1 people liked computers. People like computers because there's cool stuff that you can look at on the computer like sports, the wild, and the ocean. Also on the computer you can find out stuff that you didn't no about like what is happening right no which is earthquakes. People should use computers because if you are going vacation and you are going to @LOCATION1 and you don't no were your going you might can go on the computer and look it up on google or yahoo and they show you a map of were you wanna go to. Also you can see were to get a map the computer might show if print the map out on the computer or the computer might were you can get a map. Computers are good for you because if you wanna buy something and you don't kmow how much it cost the computer might how much it cost and were you can buy them at, you might a pear of sneakers, a jacket, a hat, a watch, a chain, or a couple shirts. People should use computers because if your in highschool or college and you need to get a job you can go on the computer and try an look for a job you might wonna go to the mall and work there the computer might show how hours you have to work if they higher you the job. But before they higher you to their job you need to show them that you are right for the job and you can show them that by coming to work on time and working very hard. People should buy computers. Computers cost a lot of money but they are worth it because you can do all kinds of things on the computer. On the computer you can look up basketball games and football games. Also you can look of stuff about animals if you want.",8
242,"Imagine a world where there are both children and adults that are addicted to technology, especially computers, I heard some people talking about the wonders of computers and what they have done to @LOCATION2. @CAPS2, others think tha't computers are affecting peoples health, how social they are towards others, and there is any too much information about people. The effects of what technology (Computers) has done far out weighs the good or them. American's health rate has been dropping recntly due to obesity and computers are difenalely causin this tragic formality. Computers have formed people into homebodies that like to get information off of the computer that doesn't include themselves and they seen to be exersising less and less. This will cause @LOCATION1 great embarisment because even though @LOCATION1 is talented in technology. Americans will be sitting on the computers all day. Obviously, computers are affecting the health of people and they need to become more active. From experience, I known that computers are addicting and that the more you are on them the more you want to go back on them. Computers are causing a social gap in the @DATE1. This is because people are now communicating from facebook, twitter, ichat, instant messaging, and emails. People are ruining their relatioship's with others and aren't spending enough time with their families (Which soon could lead to anxiety, stress, and bad gradis). Computers are ruining relatioships that they have with their family and friends, @CAPS1 time, you are brainwashed with the wonders of the computers but you don't realize the effects of them. You @MONTH1 think that computers are greay because they have improved the information we are recieving, @CAPS2, sometimes too much information can be harmful. Google is a site with tons of information about people. This way, @CAPS3 and people that could hurt you easily could find where you are with the information the computers their have them liven information opens minds, too much information could lead you into trouble. Obviously, computers are harming the @LOCATION2 because they are causing bad health, Their rvining relationships, and they are giving out too much information. The effects of computers have far what they have done for us. What would you rather do?",10
243,"I support advances in technology fully. There are many enriching benefits that come from technology at our fingertips. As we all are witnessing, our nation, our world, are becoming more and more technologically advanced every day. Though some people believe computers take away from social interaction, they are the complete apposite and actually increase social interactions shouldn't you be proud that our work is advancing? I am. If you were born in the ninety's; eightie's even, you have been around computers or known of them, your whole life. We started off typing and playing games at the age of @NUM1, maybe even younger. And since then, computers/technology have become a big part of most of our lives. There are so many amzing things that you can do with technology, research, listen to music, play video games, have a blogs and much more, with we have a more advanced society. Nowadays if we forgot a school book at school, we can acces it online. Printer isn't working? E-mail. Relatives can't make it for thanksgiving? Videocalls. Technology provides many solutions to everyday obstacle. Where be without it? The growth and well being of our world depends on the growth of technology. Hospitals provide to everyone; new born young, teens and the hospitals are full of computers. Schools contain many devices and computers to ensure a safe and rich education. Some computers even give people the ability to talk. The advances are beneficial to the public and has many benefits to our society. Facebook is a booming online blog collection that is over-flowing with members. Mostly every teen has one and I, myself do too. Facebook is a place where it's possible to share pictures, videos, news and much more. It allows you to interact with people on the whole other side of the world and stay ""caught up"" with old friends, family and even people you haven't talked to for years. And facebook isn't the only example of online interaction, there are many more. Yes, some people could spend a little less time online, but you can't blame technology for people's laziness. As you can inquire from reading this, isn't technology a wonderful thing? It's at its peak of popularity and quality. And everyone is benefitting from it. Our nation depends on it. And our youth rely on it socially. Will you be the one to pull it down?",10
244,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 opinion on computers effect on people is positive, computers benefit people in many different ways because they cam teach people so many things and they are able to retreive basically any information you are looking for. In fact, a local citizen quoted, ""I love going online because I know @CAPS5's where I can find all @CAPS2 information and I can @CAPS4 rely on @CAPS5."" I do agree with her, @CAPS3 has been stated, I deeply believe that computers have a positive effect on people because they teach you hand-eye coordination, give people an opputunity to learn about far away places, and lastly, they allow people to chat online with friends or family. @CAPS3 i said before, a benefit from computers would be, hand-eye coordination. During elementary school students are taught how to type on keyboards by not looking at their hands and only the screen; therefore, students will be able to type much faster. Hand-eye coordination and being able to type fast will definitely benefit students @CAPS3 they grew older and begin to type long essays or however   @CAPS4, now a days computers are used to   choices so being able to have hand-eye coordination will come in . So, not moving hand-eye coordination skills will not benefit you. Another way computer helps positive    they give people oppurtunity to about that for. You have the power to type in any place in the world of the computer will give you maps, images, videos and links.I personally have used the computer  or countries for school purposes and  gotten a good grade. If @CAPS5 is aren't for computer, does this people who'd be half   about. Lastly, I strongly suppport the usage @CAPS3  bestfriend @PERSON1 moved to iceland a little while ago and since I cannot text her anymore or call that easily, the computer gives me a chance to stay in touch with her by instant message, video, or email. The computer is a very important technologic device to many people. A young boy stated. ""I use video chat online to reach @CAPS2 father who is currently in @LOCATION1 for buisness, @CAPS5 is the ony way i talk to him."" This advantage in computers benefits so many people in all the same way, communication. To conclude, I strongly agree those who advance in thecnology. Computers are very imporant to our society, they help us teach hand-eye coordination, teach is about far away places, and give us ability to communicate with friends or family. I demand, you stand with me on @CAPS2 opinion about the positive effect  computers have on people",9
245,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 technology has been and will continue to grow very quickly. Computers are a very important aspect in peoples lives. Computers are very important for many reasons, computers create jobs for people, teach people various skills, and provide @CAPS3 intellegance. Computers technology is very much needed in our society. Even in todays economy, computers can give many people jobs based on their skills. According to a professor at @ORGANIZATION2, @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 work online or have received a job from a @CAPS1. If you are out of work and need to find a job you can type what job you are looking for and @PERCENT2 of the time you will a job you like. Computers are full of information on a almost everything there is to know. Computers are great teachers for various things, for example computers can help you train for your job or teach you how to cook a meal. According to @PERSON1, a father who works from home ""every afternoon I go on the @CAPS1 and find a new recipe to cook for dinner. The @CAPS1 is a life saver."" @CAPS3 inteligance is very important especially today. Without our modern day @CAPS1 technology, we would probably not be able to win any futer war. If a @ORGANIZATION3 agent go's into @LOCATION2 and finds important information they can e-mail the information back the their headquarters rather than writing a letter on paper were the letter might not make it or someone could intercept the letter. @CAPS1 technology is very important for these reasons: they provide people with jobs, they teach people various skills, and they provide the @CAPS3 with inteligance. So post a front page article on why modern day @CAPS1 technology is so important in our society. If you do so, more people will read you paper and you will gain respect from you piers and your newspaper will be the most popular newspaper in @LOCATION1.",9
246,"Dear Newspaper, I support the groth of technology. The advances and useage of todays tech and gagets. It make sociaty run smoother and makes everyday lives better and easier. These are my three reasons why: it makes us smarter, we can easally communicate with friends and fammily, and just makes our lives easier. Things like computers make us smarter, reading news articals, lurning @CAPS1 things from videos make us smarter every day. There is a lot we can learn from the internet. Say you go on your homepage and see a news artical called ""@CAPS1 dinosor discovered in @LOCATION1, sounds interesting right? You click on it to read the full artical and you learn something @CAPS1. There is stuff like that all over the internet. Technology also helps us communicate with cellphones and instant messaging we can chat whenever we want. There is messaging over the internet with video chat and chat rooms. If I need to remind my friend i'll just shoot him a text. Communicating has become so much easier because of todays technology. Without a dout, computers make every day life easier. If I need to find a artical and write a report on it I'll use technology. I won't have to find an artical in the newspaper and write it down on paper. I could look up can artical on the internet and type my paper on microsoft word. I hope that my letter has convinced you that groth in technology is good because it makes us smarter, make communicating easy and makes our lives better.",8
247,"Dear @CAPS1, I have resently read from the town newspaper in @LOCATION1 that same people is arguing if we should have computer or not have computer. As I had descover this new interesting facts, I went around the town of @ORGANIZATION1, surveying teens and adults of what they had think about this. About @PERCENT1 of the people in @CAPS2 agreed that we should keep computers and that it's a good thing. I also believe that having computer is a great idea. My first reason is that computer is a good way to teach hand eye coordination. Most people are slow are typing. So using the computer helps typing skills and it would help people when plays the piano teach a certain keys. Computers could also teach hand-eye cordination start out by exercising your finger. This is one whay how computers are good to have. My second reason is that the computers give people the ability to learn about faraway place and people. This is a good way why we should computers because then kids from school could go online to search up information about a person, places or thing for a certain project. So computer also help kids education through web. Also, many people then could able to find their long lost family's history online. This is my second reason why we should keep computer and new they're good for you. My third reason is that the computers allow people to talk online with other people. Some experts think having computer less time to interest with familys and friends. But in this case, computers helps you to comunication with alot of your friend and familys online especially long distance familys and friends. Also it helps people make new friends through chat or online pages. This is my third reason why we should keep computers and how they're good for you. In conclusion, I believe having computer is good for you and that it's a great idea. I believe this because computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and peoples, and even allow people to talk online with other people. I recommend you to allow people use the computers. This importants desicion is up to you.",9
248,"Have you ever needed help with something and you used your computer to find the answer. Well that the computer has many benefits to offer. The computer teached you hand-eye coordination. Also people are able to learn about faraway places without actually going to the places, in addition people are now able to other people in faraway places. Now-a-days some people are not able to talk. However technology has found a solution. People would now be able to talk by just looking at the screen. If they look at the screen, the screen will read the persons eyes and transfer what they need to say, on to the screen. It really helps people in need. One day I had to do a report on another country. So I went to my computer to learn about the country. It's a lot easier than going to visit the country. Also the computer is a good way country if you want to go there. You could learn what they eat, drink, and even @CAPS1 knows what a web cam is. Well now computers are made with built-in web cams. Web cams allow you to talk to in faraway places. It really comes in handy. Computer are also a great way of meeting people. They can see how you live while, you can see how they live. So I am for the idea of the benefits of computers. They could teach you about other things. You could learn about a faraway place. As well as talking to people in faraway places. The computer really comes in very handy.",8
249,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 on more and more people have been using computers. Good or bad? Well that’s why I'm here to give my opinion on the effects computers have on people. People that beileve this is a good idea agree on getting smarter, learn about faraway places and people, and also hand-eye coordination. But others disagree, and are concerned about being healthy, cyber bullying, and less time with friends, family's, and less time with nature. Their are many different ideas. Cyber bullying has been a problem @CAPS1 on. It has been going on for years. More and more kids have been caused in this incedent. There has been many incedent's over the internet. We a need a safe internet. By helping that is to spend less time on the internet. For an example less exercising. Many people are more worried about that which is a bad case. Being healthy and being in that right fit is good. We don't want more and more people using computers, and having to worry about weight, and being heathly. Experts dont wanna have to worry about that. On the other hand, computers are very technique. I beilive that the ability that computers can have on people, or the positive effect. Some good examples are talking to others online, learning about faraway places and people, and hand-eye coordiantion. But too much computer can have a negetive effect. I believe that people are spending too much time on computers, not good. Leads to many bad causes. For an example less time being down to earth, helping the world and less time with exploring nature. But most important being with family and friends. I hope you believe my opinion on the effect on computer. Because I do believe too much time with it can be bad for people. But I think spending a little time not to much is fine. But people want to be heathly, more active, and less cyber bullying. Thank you and hope you take my word for it.",8
250,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 had been a great help to one seens it was invented. Their are ways that @CAPS1 effect every one, just like what the @CAPS1 experts people said computers are very greatful, fun and enjoyable but it just had for your healthy. I believe that people should stop spending so much time on @CAPS1 because its bad in many reasons like, too much taxes bills debts, exercise and family matters. @CAPS1 is bad for you as too much taxes because you waste so much on electricity and the more you get bills the higher the taxes goes. It depends on how rich or poor you are. If you don't have jobs and you are on @CAPS1 all day not finding jobs doing some none seens work it would effect your life. It would be on debts and that would be very hard to get them paid if you don't have jobs and money. It is important to have money and stop espending time on @CAPS1. Exercise is what people need during the time that you gain weight because seating all day eating food and no nutritions you would get obis which is too fat. No one would like that kind of situation in your young age. It is good to exercise sometimes if you have a break and get your muscle going than typing, searching and emaling with friends. I don't want to be mean for those people who just love seatng and doing no exercise. Family is one tough thing to do if you get in a fight for not caring them and not even thinking about them. Spending as much time as you can on family matters because you could talk, laugh and enjoy the day than your @CAPS1. Invite friends and your family to came together just for fun and you could learn a lot from them than yourself. Family is the one you would always have no matter what happend because you could protect each other on your worries and enjoy your life. @CAPS1 doesn't help much if you have worries because you imailed them but it would take a lot of time because they might not be checking their mail all the time. Family helps a lot on your problem, teamwork and spend time with your children. You could go to park with your family and enjoy the fresh air you would always remember in your life. The @CAPS1 would damage your school work if your a student because you would not get everything done and the next day you failed on your test or exam. Bad for students to not get a good and don't stay late children and specially with adults and to get a good night sleep everyday for at least @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours a day to work your brain on the next day. Save a lot of energy would help you than @CAPS1. @CAPS1 don't go to sleep because their technology than you do. Like some experts say that spending too much time on their computers would meant less time exercising, enjoying nature around you and interacting with family and friends. I would like everyone to get a good night sleep and just spend computers a little slowly that staying late. Spend less if you can for your own good health!",9
251,"Why would it be a bad thing to use computers? It's not, people need computers for many different things. So, no people do not spend to much time on the computer because, they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places, and even allow people to talk online. Using computers teach hand-eye coordination. By playing games on the computer people learn how to react to something faster, than they would if they didn't have computers. Also, if people use computer at a young age they will know how to use it better and be able to get good jobs. Because if they know how to type then they will be able to type faster when they get older and type words a minute, that will led to good things later in there life. Another way the computer teaches hand-eye coordination is that when your taking test you wont skip a problem be misstake and get every problem form than on wrong. Computers teach use about faraway places. Think how hard it would be it if you had to o a school report on it and you did not have a computer. It would pretty hard. Or what if your planning a family vacation and you don't just went to go up to @LOCATION1 for the. What do you use to find a good place to travel to? The computer thats where! Or you know when you going, but not really wants there, the computer helps you in so many ways. Computers allow people to talk to one another online. This is good because for project at works at work people need to talk to one other because they need to know what they are doing wrong or right. School project, the kids need to know what they are doing and need to know where and when to meet. Or maybe someones baseball game got cancelled and one person doesn't know, so they other person tells him online instead of tieing up the phone lines. Maybe after a long day of school a kid just wants to talk to his friend and releaxe. So, using computers is not a bad thing because, they teach hand-eye coordination and allow people to talk to one another online. Having a computer is not a bad thing. Just do not over use it, and you will be fine.",8
252,"Since the dawn of humanity, people have argued over the implementation of technology. Some argue that modern technology, i.e, computers, retract from our core values. I am not one of them. Computer, offer incredible converiance to their users, teach valuable real world skills, and link the world together in ways that were once thought impossible. Computers have already benefitted the world greatly, so why anyone would want to limit their implementation is beyond me. Since before the @DATE1, computers have put tons of information into the hands of anyone who wants it. Before this people would have to physically go the library and tedrously search for information. Now, all one has to do is click ""search"". Surely, this is the way that is of the most ease to people, so it is surprising to see negativity toward it. Its @DATE2. Space colonization is less than @NUM1 years away, cybernetic are getting stronger and cheaper, and most businesses are run by people using computers. In this modern era computers are replacing factories and such as the new need-to-know industry. But rather than going to special schools to learn these skills, one could-use their own home computer. By simply typing up e-mails,people are the skills needed to help in the computer industry. One also, learns problem solving skills when dealing with viruses and etiqutte when communicating with unknown people. It's a new millenium, and computers have taken the forefront. Perhaps most importantly, computers connect us, People in the @LOCATION6 can instantly chat with people in @LOCATION5, and scientists in @LOCATION2 can hastily communicate with scientists in @LOCATION4. Try doing that with pigeons. With computers, preaking news in @LOCATION1 is breaking news in @LOCATION3, and families on seperate equators seem to be only a thin piece of glass away. This is the modern world, and if some people don't like the thought of it, than! I will never understand. In conclusion, computers are the present, and the future. I live in a world where converance is for everyone jobs skills are taught through lif sure, and @NUM2 million people can play one game at once (myself included). This is the modern world, and computers are its creator.",9
253,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I think people should spend less time on the computer. @PERSON1 told me that he isn't on computer much because there are better things in life then sitting in a chair in front of the computer. When you are always staring at a screan it can make you cross eyed or even need glasses. You should always want to spend time with family, work on homeworth, or even play around outdoors. I know everyone does care about their family and friends more then the computer. I wasn't on the computer for @NUM1 days in arow because everything I care about is all around me including family and friends. You can alway find away to have fun with family and friends. Someways are by sleeding, swimming, snowball fights, vacations, or many other options that I haven't mentioned. I'm sure you can think of many more great ideas that I haven't. Spend more time with your family and friends and get off the computer. Another thing I know, is that most kids don't get their homework done because they are alway playing games on the computer. Before you let your teen near the computer make sure their homework is done and done right. If your child doesn't have good grades that shows they need to make more time working and focusing on school and a little less time on computers. Do you see your kids outdoors at all? If you don't get them outside more and more each day. They will have more fun then they ever thought they would outdoors. Tell them they can have a friend over if they get off the computer and go outside. They can have a snowball fight, race, swim, or whatever else the weather alows. My mom tells me, herself, and everyone in the family tell everyone you know this and have a friend over. In conclusion don't spend your life on the computer. Spend time doing homework, hanging out with your family and friends, and go out side. All of this requires no electricity, save money and get off the computer!",8
254,"Dear Newspaper, The effect of computers on people is negative. Much of the community is spending too much time on the computer instead of tending to their other needs. People are becoming unhealthy from less exercise and less time in nature. In addition computers are causing people to spend less time with their families and friends. Due to the advance in computers, many people spend too much time on the computer. From the results of a survey, @PERCENT1 of our community spends over @NUM1 hours each day on the computer. Think of the neglect that their homes and pets must be getting. People are becoming so engrossed in their computers that they are forgetting to clean their homes and feed their pets. How can computers be becoming a good thing when people's other obligations are being neglected? Not to mention that people are spending less time exercising and enjoying nature. A little over @PERCENT2 of our community has become obese since the advance in computer technology. When asked about changes in her life since the advance in computers @PERSON3 black had this to say. ""@CAPS1's true there has been a change in my life, I used to run @NUM2 miles each day, but since I have became addicted to my computer I barely run at all."" @CAPS2 of our town are unhealthy the are spending less time enjoying the beautiful nature in our town and more sitting infront of the computer screen. Don't you see a problem here? People have been spending less and less time interacting with their family and friends. @NUM3 in every @NUM4 @CAPS2 admit that since the advance in computers they have not spoken with their friends and family in @NUM5 straight weeks, where they used to speak with them every couple days. @PERSON1 says of sister @PERSON2 that @PERSON2 has not answered or responded to her calls at all since the advance in computers. Computers are pulling family and friends apart. With the advance in computers, when will these victims realize that they are alone with only their computer neglecting their real friends and family? In conclusion, the advance in computers is having a negative effect on @CAPS2. @CAPS2 are spending way too much time on the computer causing them to neglect their obligations. Our community is slowly yet strongly becoming physically and mentally unhealthy. Friends and family have been pulled apart due to the advance in computers. We must stop this advance in technology for the sake of our fellow @CAPS2.",10
255,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 a days more and more people use Computers Some people belive computers benefit our society but I understand not everyone does. Personaly, I belive compoters do benefit our society. One reason why I belive computers benefit our society is because they give people the ability to learn about other countries and people in other countries. On time I had to do a report on @PERSON1 and how she spent time with gorillias in other countries. Also, I think Computers benefit our society because they allow people to talk to each other online. One advantage of talking to each other online is if one of your close friends move can still keep-in-touch with them without running up your phone bill. Did you @CAPS3 @PERCENT1 of kids talk to each other online. Another reason why I agree that computers benefit our society are because it teaches hand-eye coordination. I belive hand-eye coordination is very important to hace for me I need to have hand-eye coordination because I play soft-ball and basketball. I understand why you might think computers don't benefit our society but I hope your thoughts have changed.",7
256,"Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1 you know people who work on computers all day are more obise than people who don't? I think people spend to much time on the computer. I say this because my mother works on the computer all day, then when she gets home she goes on @CAPS2. She is starting to gain weight. She doesn't spend enough time with her family and she doesn't go outsid unless it's to the car. First of all she is starting to gain weight because she is at work all she obese is sit at her desk all day, then when she gets home all she obese is go downstairs on the computer, and when she eats that is where you can find her. this isn't just my mother that doese this. Accountants do the same thing and so do lawers. this is why people need to spend more time off the computer and with their families. Secondly, people who work on computers all day don't spend enough time with their families. For example my friend has a dad who is an accountant. He is always teling me how he wishes he could spend more time with his family. I feel the same with my mom. If she spent more time with us than mabey she would be able to get out of the house are. Lastly, I don't think these people get enough time outside. Most people who have worked on computers all their life love became diabetics because they don't get enough exercise to keep their bodys healthy. For example my mother when she gets have she takes everything insid but bother to pat it away she goes strait to the computer. If she realize she left something in the car she runs to go get it and is always out of breath when she cames back. Then she goes to the computer to cool off. This is why people don't enjoy nature, get enough exercise, and get to see alot of their family. Theirfore why don't us do something about these who sit on their buts all day?",9
257,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think that computers do benefit societies because people think computers are important to them. Here are a few reasons why, @CAPS3 reason is computers have a positive effect on people. They love to check out cool websites on line. They can go on websites that they've already been to or try something new. Also, if people are trying to get work done online, the computer can help them get the job done. That way people don't have to struggle without @CAPS3. Another reason is people can talk with @CAPS3 another online. They could talk by @CAPS4 or by @CAPS5 chat. So, say for example, if someone wanted talk to a cousin they haven't seen in a while, they could via @CAPS5 chat online or maybe just talk to a friend just because they're bored. An easier way would be to @CAPS6 a friend and talk about how your life or his/her life is going. It's a great way to connect with other people. My last reason is kids and teens can do fun things online. For example, they can play games and activities on random websites. They could also make crafts on @CAPS7 @CAPS8 like make a card for a special occasion or something. They could also make music or videos to post for friends and family. But most importantly, they could just express themselves in many ways. So, now that you've heard my top @NUM1 reasons, do you think that computers benefit society? People think that computers are the best pieces of technology. You need to understand the importance of this, so please write back @CAPS9 with your decision. Thank you for your time.",8
258,"I think that computers have a great effect on people. Computers help people by giveing directions, getting answers and getting gifts. My first reason is that a computer can give you directions. @PERCENT1 of people get lost because they do know the direction. The computer will give you direction to anywhere. For example you need to get from your house to the hospital and you don't know the directions? A computer can help you get the directions. Do you realy want to get lost. Next a computer will help you get answers. The makers of google say ""you can find all your answers here on google"". For example say you need the question to how to change brakes on a car? Go on google and you can find out how to. but on least, a computer will help you get gifts for people. Did you know @PERCENT2 of people can't find what gift theyre looking for. The other people say you can find anything in stores. Don't listen to them not all stores have are looking for. American.com states we have all you no what it is we have . So is this a god idea or what. To conclude a compter will help you got and get do help society in what you just read.",7
259,"Dear @CAPS1: I belive that computers are a benefit to society. Computers are a very important part of life. They make life a whole lot easier then having to do something off knowledge. A computer is able to let you talk with friends or family that live in different areas all over the world. It also allows use to do research and make new discoveries. The computer is one of the most helpful utensils in this world. In short, computers make life easier without a doubt. They allows us to do homework assignments, reports, make the newspaper, etc. without a computer having to do this all by hand would be a some homework assignments require you to do research in a topic. It is go to the library to pick out a book but on the computer you would be able to gather more information in a faster of time. Reports might also report research to if a source of information could be gathered in a shorter amount of time why not use the computer. Then theirs your newspaper. The computer allow you to make the newspaper faster than you would help when you only had type written. The evolution in technology helps make our life less @CAPS2, talking to friends and family all over the world is something a computer was made to do we like facebook, myspace, aim, etc. If your family lives in a country such as @LOCATION1 and you wont be able to if you live in a different part of the world you would still talk to friends and a good friend or another miles away from when you live, probably wouldn't them there. You would go the internet to talk to him/her and keep in touch. This doesn't mean that you would be to spend time with friends and family. Schedule your time so could fit talking to distant family and hanging out with friends or family after school. Lastly, the computer lets use new discoveries about places or find something and a location that we have never been to. If you wanter to ho on vacation to a tropical area you might which areas are tropical and the places that are freezing cold all year long. If you wanted to explore places with the computer could find that information in a matter or But some people and forget that they like exercise. To sum it all us, computers are a good thing to have because of more benefits in society. They make life easier. In no task, we are allowed to interact with family or friends that live in different areas make new or find out information about places you never knew about.",9
260,The witers you are the big loseers why won't people get off computer. Why try to save all the comptureys in the State that why i don't like the cant's of that because make me every mad of the agree with the people that why you are mad sackers the why no one likes you the agrees with the people what i don't you are make me bad today happen yasterday. I big tover that i am mad at this no half days u want half days every day. The computers show a lot bad stiff on the computers kiids can't like of the stiff on the computers i don't want no onetime computers I want cames and xbox @NUM1 xbox live of million people go on take to your friends that why i don't want no on the computeres that why cost to much money.,6
261,"Computers have been around for not very long. Still, a few generations, including my own, have been raised on this technology. We @MONTH1 not be as social and outside as our parents and grandparents, but that doesn't mean anything. We can't go out as much as they could becaue of the many dangers outside our doors. Computers are also here to help with homework, look up local news, or just search for something to do like seeing a movie. Another factor is that they @MONTH1 not be perfect, but computers teach us an important lesson that we should all attempt to follow. When past generations were kids, they had so much freedom and time to have fun. They would return home from school, complete their homework and chores, and then they were out to see their friends. They were able to do this because all of the people in town knew each other so if theynoticed something suspicious, they reported it. Today most neighbors don't know each other so kids can't be looked after while out playing ball. The world is a cruel place with killers, rapists, addicts, and much more. To caps with this teens and children look for an alternative. It just so happens that we have computers which we can do anything on. For instance, i could play a game watch a video on youtube, listen to music, talk to friends, and search the""@CAPS1"". Yet adults want to take that away despite it being the only other thing we got. You msut look at what computers do for us that's good not just what's bad. Say i just hopped off the bus and am loaded with week to do. I pull out my math and it looks like another language to me. I then could just bring go the internet and look up how to do it. There's almost every possible""how to"" guide or the @CAPS1 so if you're having trouble starting up the lawn mower, then lok it up. Even if you're just bored or curious, any information can be obtained via the computer. Without @CAPS2.C.s or @PERSON1, our entire civilization would be last. Still, if ou ask most people, they'll tell you that the internet and computers are dark and evil places. That they're full of sick people and videos, but that's not necessarily true. Yes, there are many bad things on the internet, but there is in life too, right? In fact, i believe it is a great that there are very bad things online but you have to listen. Say you catch your child doing something bad like getting into fights. You'd sit him/her down and talk to them or punish them right? They'd learn from their mistake and probably wouldn't do anything like that again so why wouldn't that apply to computers too? Computers can teach us, through mistakes, how to be better people. In the end, i believe there @MONTH1 be a lot wrong with computers, but that they have a much better side too. Our world has changed, they're have to help, and they teach us an important life lesson. So why shouldn't they stay?",10
262,"Dear Newspaper, I disagree with those experts, who say that people are spending to much time on their computers. I am pretty sure that people aren't on their computer most of their day. I think computer made society a lot easier. I'll tell you why. One reason I think computers have good affects on people is because they help children on school work. The computer helps children in a lot of ways. For example if a child needed to know the defenition of a word and they didn't have a dictionary, they can just look it up on the internet. The computer makes it easier for kids to find things. Instead of looking through a whole bunch of books, they can just go on the computer and get the information there. Therefore, the computers have good affects on people. Another reason I think computers have good affects on people is because it helps people of their job. At a lot of jobs computers are necessary. For example, teachers need computer for grades and assignments, people who work at the bank need computer to know who took out money and etc... Many jobs include working on a computer. Computers make work easier at jobs. Therefore, computers have good affects on people. Another reason I think computers have good affects on people because you learn more. You learn how to do many things. For example, if you typing an essay the computer checks the grammar. The computer see mistakes that you might have missed and points it out to you. You can find information in a computer easier than taking a while looking, for the information in a book. It makes work a whole lot easier. Therefore, I think computers have good affects on people. Now I hope the people who read this letter see where I am coming from. So, therefore, in my opinion, computers have good affects on people. ",8
263,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers have positive effects on people everyday. They allow people to research far away places and people. People can also use them to talk to people online and learn hand-eye coordination at the same time. One benefit that people gain from using computers is learning and researching about far away places and people. For example, if someone wanted to learn more about @LOCATION1, they can log into their computer and search @LOCATION1. By learning about @LOCATION1 people can be more aware of the people that live there too. @CAPS1 is a chance to learn the differences and similarities between their lifestyle without having to go on a trip. Since the computer provides all of this information people are @PERCENT1 more aware of all the global issues and not only the ones where the person lives. Also learning about a different place or culture might interest or encourage the person to actually visit the place and learn even more about @CAPS1 even with the research. In addition to providing information about different places, computer also teach people hand-eye coordination. Using a keyboard without looking helps people develop skills such as hand-eye coordination, @CAPS1 is important to have excellent typing skills because @CAPS1 can help students with their schoolwork and adults with their careers. Teachers @MONTH1 assign essays or prompts that must be typed and @CAPS1 would be beneficial for students to have the ability to type their essay efficiently. If a person has hand-eye coordination then @CAPS1 can also improve the way they play a sport. Some jobs require adults to have typing skills such as a secretary. Someone could not get the job they want because they don't have enough knowledge of computers to be able to do @CAPS1. Another reason that computers have a positive effect on people is that @CAPS1 even allows people to talk online with other people. This is positive because sometimes someone's best friend moves far away and can't call them because its long distance. They can use the computer to stay in touch with the person by talking to them with email, facebook, or @CAPS2. Also they can plan to meet each other once a year by losing the computer to communicate to one another. Even if the person doesn't live far away people can still talk to their friends online. They can socialize and plan events that can happen on the weekends or after school the next day. Some experts say that computers are not allowing people to interact with family and friends. that is not true because they can talk online and plan to meet each other and interact with them. In conclusion, computers positively effect people. The computer teaches people hand-eye coordination, and far away play and people. @CAPS1 is also a way people can talk to each other and stay in touch. People should be encouraged to use their computers.",10
264,"Thirty or so year ago, technology was not exactly advanced. People did not have the technological our society has today, yet they live just fire.

Machines have really""taken over"" just like on those cheezy old-families. Without a doubt, society is @PERCENT1, dependent on their @CAPS5, and other technology. Is that healthy? Do you believe computers help or hurt our lives as @CAPS6, and humans? Many of us enjoy the wonders of @CAPS7's fine creation; unlimited texting! We text every we go, our cellphones are almost a part of us. Dont get me wrong, I love our generation's advancements on technology. In fact, I think computers make out lives much easier. If you want to do research on @PERSON1 for your @CAPS8 month project. The internet's got you covered. The old fashioned folks still prefer the library, but not us. If you want to talk to a friend, really quickly, just text them, their just a click away. A few uninlighted people, might think all of this technology just how lazy. What these few people who the virtual computers lives more convinient, @NUM1 out of @NUM1 teens say. In addition my fellow reader of the @CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11, computers teach us tons of things! Typing is a must have skill in today to work. Obviously Computers also have a variety at endless topics available to. The internet is like a gigantic library that offers you anything, and everything with just a click of a button. So explore away, you'll be amazed at the things youll in the of the iternet. too much of is bad for you. This also goes for the remarkably fascinating cyber world. It is important to about life outside your. there is many great things outside of a computer, @CAPS12 seems essential to and they use, however, it is to about family, friends and that good stuff. Use computers's moderately, your wife and kids will appreciate it. Before you try using that line of advice on kids, save your breath. It will not work. What have we learned today my fellow readers? the world of computers offer us many great things, and we should take advantage. If that, we would be fools not too. Those of us who are smart enought to understand the importance of computers in our daily lives, have accepted the challenge and are now part of our generation's finest achievement. When I look at my @NUM3 something year old @CAPS13 ma playing on the computer. I know it is not an impossible task and all can be to this @CAPS9 technology. Even our @CAPS14 @PERSON2 knows the importantce to reaching younber audiences by logging onto @CAPS3. @PERSON2 says,""The internet is apart of our lives, and it's a positive thing.

265,"Who would rather stare at a bright nausiating screen than share time with your friends? Why would you sit inside, lying around when you could be running around outside in the fresh air? Why not get up and get active? You should want to hangout with friends run around, and enjoy the outdoors. Here's the controversy: does technological advances hurt people more than they help? Technology makes children and adults less active. @PERSON1, a specialist from the @ORGANIZATION1 organization @CAPS1 that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 @CAPS2 spend more time watching @CAPS3 and on the computer that outside, getting exercise. This is a huge problem because that can lead to obesity. Obesity can cause high blood pressure and diabetes. Some people @MONTH1 say technology gives you better hand-eye coordination. This @MONTH1 be true however, wouldn't you rather be getting the same or even better hand-eye coordination by playing sports, which also benefit your health. Replace video games with baseball and get more things in return. Enjoying nature is fun and captivating. The beautiful, colorful flowers fill your nose with delighting scents. There are blushing roses and cheery sunflowers. Along with plants there are lots of different animals scampering around outside. Birds are perched up on a tree, chirping back and form as if conversing about their day. Not only is nature wonderful to look at, it gets you out of the house and away from time-wasting things like computer games. Before turning on that television, remember what living things were already given to this world, waiting for you to take in their beauty. Time with friends and family is something you want to hold on to and cherish. Why waste it ""surfing the net"" on gazing blankly at a box. People who care about their loved ones would rather spend their time with them instead if inanimate object. Family and friends are what are important in life. You should care most about them. Try to peel yourself of the @CAPS3 screen and talk to the ones who care most. Now is the time to see whether you support technology advances or think you could be doing better things. You could be running around, having fun while staying healthy. Bright flowers and giddy animals are right outside your door. Most importantly the people around you should get more time from you than your electronics so get off that couch, get outside and spend time with people you care about the most!",11
266,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 computers have become increasingly popular and advanced. So much so that I feel they are intefering with our lives andv having negative effects on the @CAPS4 people @CAPS5 example, many people spend hours on computer when they could be excercising and staying healthy. Another negative effect is how much computers cost, and the financial problems computers brings. Lastly, computers are a huge factor of how families have been spending less & less time together. One way computers effect us is exercise. Many people practically live on their computers and never leave the house. This is a problem, especially with the obesity issue how it is already in @LOCATION1. It is a fact that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS12 spend more time on their computers than exercising. It is not healthy to sit at a computer, ""frying your brain"", (as my mom would say) and not exercising at all. Why not go take a jog, or go to the gym with your friends, @CAPS6, I've chosen backyard football with neighborhood friends over computers many times, and I've been happy with that choice. I beleive that computers are effecting how much exercise we got and not in a positive way. If everyone ditched computers @CAPS5 a little while and exercised a little more, we'd be closer to erasing our countries tttle of the.""@CAPS7 @CAPS8 in the @CAPS9."" @CAPS10 the negative effect computers have on excercise is a major issue, it is not the only one. Another huge issue is their effect on money and financial problems. New technology is cool, but it comes with a price (literally), Technology, especially computers, is getting more experience almost by the day. Computers are ridiculously expensive, and it is starting to have an effect on the people wallets. Many people feel the need to have the bigger and better things, such as new computers. Some people buy a new computers model when it comes out just to say they have it. Who has hundreds of @MONEY1 to spend in the blink of an eye to buy a new computers which also supply you with even more bills. You need to pay @CAPS5 repair bills, @CAPS11 my computer broke and my dad had to spend close to @MONEY1 trying to fix it. And many people have computer in their house. This could let to financial problems and here are better things to spend money as such as healthy fresh foods that our body deserves. Computers have also started to limit the amount of family time that @CAPS12 are getting. Several families almost never speak to one another because they are to buried in their computers. One good example of this was on the @ORGANIZATION1 show. @ORGANIZATION1 had a family on @CAPS13 that was totally anti-social with one another. The mother would make dinner, and the other family members would just grab it and take it whenever to eat. The dad went to his office to do work on his laptop, the son went to his room to use the computers, and the daughter did the same. The mother was left alone, either to use a computer or to sit & eat by herself. This is a great example of how computer can and are effecting the amount of family time @CAPS4 families are having. With computers taking over their lives many families now spend little or no time with their family. There are so many other things to do, like to take a family bike ride, take a road trip, make a family craft, or even play a board game or learn to cook. The only way to get better families is to closer, and computers are restricting the amount of family time families are recieving. Now I hope you see the negative effects computers are having on @LOCATION1. lack of exercise, wasted money and minimal family time are only a few problems. If we didn't have computers, these problems would go away. @CAPS10 computers do have some benefits, it would be better in the long run @CAPS5 them to disapear. That is my opinion.",12
267,"Dear local Newspaper, People seem to be using computers a lot more, well this is a great thing, computers are used to @CAPS3 anything, @CAPS1, surf the web, chats, buissness, typing letters, movies, news, research, hand-eye coordination. Those are only a few things computers are good for. I believe that computers @CAPS3 benefit society. The first good thing about computers is it teaches hand-eye coordination, Hand-eye coordination can come into good use such as, keyboarding, typing school paper, searching websites, searching research on google and typing buissness papers. All these things become something in sentence everyday life and hand-eye coordination helps and does a big part in typing. The next thing which helps everyone is using a computer for learning. And I mean learning about anything. You name it and a computer has information about it.Whether it be pictures or websites with pages of typed words. A few examples are, differenr cultures, foods, technology, schools,science,math,history,english,celebrities,music,supplies,stores,clothing,accesories, places, everything is on a computer. A computer can teach you different and A system that The last thing @CAPS1 @CAPS3 you I know I way of teensv and @CAPS4 with a computer have a facebook account. Facebook is made so you can chat with your friends and family who @MONTH1 live faraway. You can also post pictures and send videos to each other. Facebook is mostly for @CAPS4 and teens who wants to chat and reconnect with family and friends. But speaking of chatting with each other, another way chatting on a computer is used is webcams. Webcams are little cameras either installed into your laptop or its attached to your computer. You turn it on and you and your friend can talk and see each other over the computer! It's great, and family who live far away @CAPS3 it too! In conclusion, I beleive computers are not causing any problems and they are use then correctly and they benefit our society.",9
268,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 you have a @CAPS5? I also believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers help in many ways. You can play games when you are stressed, they can be used for research, and allow you to talk to friends and family online. After a long day of work or school people can be pretty tired. Why not sit down in front of the @CAPS5 and play some games? Dr. @DR1 @PERSON1 says ""Computers are great way to take off the pressure of a stressful day of work. I would reccomend to anybody who is stressed to sit down and play some @CAPS5 games."" @CAPS5 games can also teach you about hand eye coordination. If you @CAPS4 a sport having hand eye coordination is important. For example; in compell cheerleading, through my expereinces, you are lifting people into the air and if they fall you need to be able to chach them. If you you don't have good hand eye coordination you wont be able to check the person you are lifting. Nobody knows everything. Computers are a good source for research. They can help you with finding the right vaction spot, if you need to @CAPS4 a project for school or work, and even if you just want to learn more. If everybody had computers @PERCENT1 of students grades will increase because the @CAPS5 will help them. And the information they need for their projects. @CAPS4 you like to go on vacation with your family? The @CAPS5 can help you find cheap vactions in minutes. All you have to @CAPS4 is a little research and in no time you will be flying off to a week of fun with your family. A lot of people don't have cellphone how are they support to keep in with friends and family? If they have @CAPS5 all they have to @CAPS4 is go online. @CAPS5 allow you to video chat, voice chat, and just type. With video chat it is just like having in the with you. Video chat lets you talk to another perosn and see them whos your talking to them. If you have family in another you can to them using video chat, voice chat is just like a phone call but it is over the @CAPS5. With voice chat you don't have to put a phone up to your ear you can hear people through speakers on your @CAPS5. For people who would rather just read you can type messages to other people. This way you can start a nice conversation while your doing other things like cooking.

269,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1, @CAPS1! A muse that's used on computers has just clicked on a game for someone to play. Computers have advanced so much through the years. Lets face it, the majority of people throughout the world have at least one computer in their house hold. But the amont of time that people go on the computer for is really the real world and cyber bullying are key factors as to why computers @CAPS9't benefit society. Let's take a deeper look into those issues. Running, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 and waking are all forms of exercise right? I @CAPS9't think anywhere in @CAPS8's something about cliking a button or mouse. Truth is, as @CAPS5 grows, so does the amount of people who are overweight. But, @CAPS11 you stay on the computer for more than hour, and ddon't exercise, that is not gona to make the rise for overweight people in @LOCATION1. Some say clicking a button could be beneficial but I just @CAPS9't agree. I'm more than @PERCENT1 sure that @CAPS11 every single @CAPS5 was allowed to go on the computer for just anneccessary and up their exercise, that maybe the overweight number will decrease of course, that goes into eating healthy. Exercise benefits the society, not computers. ' @CAPS7, are you coming house?"" "" Not, I'm to my friends on !"" @CAPS8 is nothing to her mother. Computers seperate teens from the real world. Most teenageers most likely talk to their friends on the computer then for a test. That goes for adults to the computer and world chat then go to , @CAPS9't you think on the computer that I'm sure not happen in the real world. Computers the bring it together. @CAPS13. The one word most @CAPS10 deny doing. Yet, a lot of @CAPS10 @CAPS9't even notice their doing it. it comes to all different forms. It court be as little as calling someone a name or as threatening to kill someone. I'm taking a shot here but, a lot of these @CAPS10 who do it, know for a fact, that they wouldn't say it to the persons face. @CAPS8 are @CAPS10 who are scared to come to school because of @CAPS13. How does that benefit the society? @CAPS10 being scared is defiently not good it's the total opposite. @CAPS13 is hot the way to go. In the end, it's really up to the person themselves @CAPS11 they want risk their health by not exercising, or seperating themselves from their family, or maybe even bullying someone on the computer Exercising, @CAPS12 and @CAPS13 are all reasons for why computers @CAPS9't benefit the society. Stop the growth of Computers.",10

Computers let anyone who wants to learn about foreign countries. Computers teach you to search for information yourself. They also allow you to communicate with anyone in the world. COmputers benefits as because they allow us to learn about foreign countries teach us to seek out our own information and let us communicate with anyone in the world. Firstly, computers give us acess to other civilizations. They give us the ability to study foreign customs. They let us learn about differenr types of food. they give us acess to all parts of that country.

271,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 there have been many arguments about computers and their effects. I, personally, have mixed feelings. Computers can have a lot of pros and cons! For one, many people don’t get enough @CAPS7 when they own a computer, especially teengers. But also, we can gain alot of knowledge from computers. Finally computers can take you away from or even connect you to, your family. Computers could really benfit us, or do the exact opposite. In todays world of technology, hours can pass without being noticed. This could become a very bad thing, because then @CAPS7 would be pushed aside @PERCENT1 of teenagers aged @NUM1 stated that they spend at least three hours after school on the computer. That's three hours of son wasted when, instead of chatting to friends online, they could have gone outside and exercised. Also, dont forget the parents! With sites like @CAPS5, when lets them talk to friends and play games they could be sucked in too.""@CAPS6 wait does any of this have to do with @CAPS7?"" you might ask. Truthfully, everything. During the day, when just walking around outside be @CAPS7, people the computer. Do you think anyone wants to @CAPS7 in the dark? I sure don't @CAPS7 is greatly imported by computers. With the use of computer, we can learn so much. work, we constantly need to learn different countries. Their conditions, culture, economy, you it. What computers, we would be able to receive this easily, if at all. Second, we can even learn about our owe country. Computers help with our leaving eryday. The @CAPS8 of computer and is very mixed. For example computers can contact you and your family you have hour family tourch with each others. Also, computers can take you away from the family. If everyday your on the computer, soon if not carefol, you could start spending all your time on it, even eating at it. Finally, sending pictures and video through email is very common. From a childs frist steps to a graduation, if somebody unfortunatly coudn't be there, it could seem like they were. Through",9
272,"Dear Local Newspaper. I hear that many experts believe that people spend way to much time on the computer, well thats why im writing this. I disagree on your opinion because from what I hear the computer helps the human body with alot of things. Like it teach then hand-eye cordination. It also gives them the chance to communicate, lets them learn about where they are from and about other people and places. The reason why I disagree on the experts opinion is cause without the computer how else would people learn about where they live and other places, besides books. Like say book wasn't invented how else would we know about where we live and stuff. Computers all you have to do is find a computer and you would know. Like if you don't know how to reach the computer will teach you just go to the website and say wat you want to read and it pops-up. Another reason I disagree is because the computer helps you on your hand-eye cordinates too. Cause when you are typing or messaging some one you are using you hand cordination. And when you are reading something you are using you eye cordination, like there are many more way the computer help people. The computer also does other things. It lets you communicate with people you know or @MONTH1 not know. Like surpose that you have a family member that lives faraway and no only can talk of the computer you both can communicate if you can talk over the computer to. Now do you see why I disagree it so you would change your opinion. But if not you just don't get that the computer is alway needed.",8
273,"Dear Local Newspaper, I am taking the time to write this letter, because I feel that computers are beneficial to everyday life. Not only do they improve hand-eye coordination, but there are many websites to find long-lost friends or that special someone. Computers also can be combined with software to create the ultimate learning experience. It's rather simple to see why computers are beneficiary. Right off the bat, hand eye coordination is improved. No pen intended, but I play baseball and I feel that my computer time has helped up my batting average to five hundred. Experts that spending all day on a computer will soften your brain and make you a slouch. This is true, but not if the computer is used in moderation, like everything in life. Those same ""expert"" providing us with false accounts are probably the ones who sit slouched at a computer all day. Who are t hey to lie to us? I strongly believe that many physical activities are positively by sports. Without further ado, it is so easy (a caveman could do it) to keep in touch with old friends and relatives, or possibly even find the love of your life. Modern day websites, such as @CAPS1, allow everyone with internet access, to reliably go online and chat with their friends. Sure, it @MONTH1 not be the same as talking wiht that friend in person, but what if they live halfway across the world? It's the next best thing in life. I, personally, don't have an account in this website, but approximately ninety percent of my friends do, and it largely impacts their everyday lives. Many modern day softwares, such as @CAPS2 @CAPS3, (a language program) help our nation, and even the world. Soldiers in the great @LOCATION1 need to know basic things in many languages, because they wouldn't be able to interact with @CAPS4 the @CAPS5 interpreter. Without translation efforts, and many other effects, we could be losing the war, horridly, we wouldn't be such a great nation if we were free, because freedom is our biggest right as an independent country. Coming to a conclusion, computers ar beneficiary to everyday life. They improve abilities, such as hand-eye coordination, and provide sample resources to find long-lost friends. Computers also have software compatibility, so that our nation can be free. Well, there's not much left to say, so go publish this and let the people hear the truth!",10
274,"Dear @CAPS1, I am a supporter in technology and I belive comptures are an important part in use them for work, recreation, and to learn new and current things around the world. Computer with hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about current events and far away places, also the opportunity in communicate with others several away in many different ways. I belive computers are a very useful tool that should be used to extent. Computers in schools all access @CAPS2 mue and continue to help children lean educate them with materials that possibly could not be taught in the classroom. They teach kids with special needs hand-eye coordination and moter skills. Without computers kids would be mostly taught which isn't bad but its not the same as having valuable a information a click away. Have you ever been to forigen country? Or are you doing a project in school on one and you need some quick facts. You turn to an encyclopida that was published in @DATE1. Maybe the leader has your country war @LOCATION1. Whats the population today? You wouldn't know. The book all you would have to do would be to go online and type in ""@LOCATION1."" @CAPS3! Easy as that. You have the population, feeds curent leader everything to know. With modern day you can learn about far away place out trip there. Do you have family that doesn't live near you but you wish you could jump on that computer and pop up @CAPS4! On that website, and others like it, you can chat with friends and family that are far away from you. Even if you just perfer to chat with someone online in a chat room, the computer many ways of having you communicate with others. Talk to them? Computers are a very resourcefull tool and when used properly it can benifit you in your school work, social life, keep you updated in current events, help you about, and even entertain you and you friends with a fun game or a watch. I am a strong beliver in modern day technology and computers alot to offer so I say use them to their full extent.",9

276,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 people believe that computers are one of the best pieces of technology in this world today. However, computers can actually be much more of a nuisance than people realize. Computers do serve their purpose and they are very useful, but computers take the place of too @CAPS3 important things. Computers have such a negative effect on people, which is destroying our society. Computers have this bad effect on people because this technology takes time away from people exercising, people rely to much on computers, and it takes time away from interacting with family and friends. Have you ever wondered why @LOCATION1 is sometimes referred to as fat? Well, this is because citizens of this country don't spend enough time exercising, and spend too much time on the computer. The average persons is on the computer for at least an hour a day. According to health statiticians, a person should get at least an hour of exercise a day. The time that is spent on the computer could be used for exercise. Now @CAPS4 you're really ""glued"" to the computer, you can still use it while exercising. For example, while my dad is using the treadmill, he watches television series on the computer. So. being on the computer for a long time is not an excuse for not exercising. Unfortunately, way too @CAPS3 people don't believe this, which is part of the reason why computers have such a negative effect on people. @CAPS3 parents of children who go to school agree that students rely too much on computers. This is very true. When students get home, they go on the internet to find the answer to their home work. Instead of ""surfing"" the web, these children could easily walk to the library and get an encyclopedia or dictionary to find the answers. @NUM1 times out of @NUM2, you can find answers better in a book than online. In addition, kids always rely on things like e-mail to stayin touch with each other. Whatever happened to calling someone, or mailing a letter to them? It can be guareenteed that @CAPS4 the internet across the world was shutdown for even just a day, kids would go insane. This has a negative effect on the human mind because people don't know how to work hard anymore because everything is on a computer. now, why should our society be destroyed by just a little piece of technology? How @CAPS3 people get to interact with friends and family on a daily basis? The answer is: not too @CAPS3 @CAPS4 people would take some time a way from computer, they could interact with family and friends. Instead of contacting there people through a computer, it would be much better to actually see them in person. Furthermore, instead of playing game on the computer, you could invite some friends over your house to have a friendly game of cards. The kids have fun, and get to interact with each other @CAPS5, instead of e-mailing your family, family, you could have dinner with them somewhere. It gives everyone a chance to catch up on things. Plus, @CAPS3 people seem to have a better time when they can verbally interact with each other, rather than through a computer. @CAPS4 computers didn't take the place of family and friends interacting, maybe this technology wouldn't have a bad effect. In conclusion, it is clear that computers have a negative effect on people. First of all, computers take time away from people exercising. Secondly, people rely too heavily on computers. Last, computers take time a way from people interacting with family and friends. Think about it. Computers are having bad effects on people, and we don't even realize it. @CAPS4 we are supposedly such a strong country, how can we let the simple computer slowly destroy our society?",11
277,"Dear, Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 computers is a good thing but in most cases I disagree with @CAPS2 people use them. I know most people who have computers or don't, are debating about problems, the amount of time people spend on the computer and how these machines effect the environment. Lets take a glimpse at those ideas. Did you know that the amount people spend on the computer is @NUM1 hours average a day! In my opinion that means @CAPS3 and the rest of the people in the world use their time in the computer way too much. @PERSON3 a computer opperator told @ORGANIZATION1 that he is fixing more and more computers each year. To me this means laptops and such can't handle the way people are using them. This is a big bennefactoring problem to the usage of computers. More await for you to know. People next to the computer for hours but what they really don't know, is that could cause obesity, and maybe even eye problems ""In the time we are on the computers we been exersizing"" says @PERSON2 at @CAPS4 @CAPS5 school. @PERCENT1 of obisity in the world is from the computer and people not doing something else like enjoying nature. In addition to obisity, computers are changing the world dramaticly, by making people different. If people are different they treat the environmen differently, either for better of for worse. I think for worse. @PERSON1, Nature preserver noticed and reported less and less people out of the house to enjoy nature each @DATE1. Even very @CAPS5 populated states has reported less people outside in the environment. They say @PERCENT2 of their population is in their homes either on the computer or some other technology device. It's not good to use computers when we can enjoy our planet while we have it. If we keep using computers the environment will get ruined even more, we will have @CAPS5 populations of overweight citizens, and the time spent on the computer will be almost all the time, we need to do something fast about computers as well as other devices like cell phones. Therefore, I say maybe higher prices so @CAPS5 on computers, and make people pay even more for internet. We can figure something out to help with this situation.",9
278,"A computer is considered a genius to people. It can provide information and chat with other people. Although these things great, you forget about yourself. Your eyes will be glued to the screen, but not on yourself. Books have been a great resource to everyone around the world. They provide information. Computers provide information, but they don't let you exercise, spend time with family, and enjoying nature. Anyone that has a computer knows you can do almost anything on it. Some people don't understand there are people that steel information from you with viruses. Those people can take your credit card number and many more important information from you. Did you know @LOCATION1 is the fattest country? Many people say it's from fast food. That is true, but it is also from sitting in a chair all day with your eyes glued to a screen. Why would you do that when your friends and family are, waiting to have fun with you? The computer has many websites that allow you to play games. Why would you do that when you can play games with family and friends? As you are doing that you are also enjoying nature and exercising at the same time. Only caring and friendly people would want to do this, but unpleasant and grampy people sit in a chair all day ingnoring everything but a computer. Ninety percent of @CAPS1 get married to a male or female. If you are the person that loves your computer, marry it. People who get married to a person are considered normal. Computer lovers are considered weird. Do you want to be a normal person that has a great time away from computers or not? Statistics say that a computer is the master of providing information. Why would you get information from a box when you can get it from a library? Why do you think libraries were built, to look pretty? All the intellegent people read books to find information. If someone has kids they need to learn to read. Eighty-five percent of all children that start reading at a young age are most likely to be very successful as an adult. At a library you can get information and meet new people at the same time. You cant do that with a computer. ""@CAPS2 am I loosing money; I didnt buy anything?"" That is what a person would say when someone found a way to get in your computer and take your credit card number. Yes, a computer can do many things, but they can also do some bad things. Smart and responsible people would know what a virus is once it is in your computer. There are some people that are very intellegent and bad. Those people send viruses to people on computers to steel data from you. If someone spends a long time on a computer then the virus will have enough time to get to your computer. If you just close down the computer nothing will happen. Computers have viruses, but the only virus someone can get is when it is winter and get the flu. Would you rather get sick for a short time or loose your information forever? Sixty-nine percent of people that spend their whole day on the computer get a virus in there computer and get stolen. It is alright to spend a short time on the computer.",10
279,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 im going to start off saying I agree with you but then I disagree. I agree because yea computers are very helpful to kids it helps us do our homework, school projects, and helps us with more stuff but I also disagree because people do get excersise moving your fingers are helping you exersise so is breathing and it also helps with peoples typing the more you type @CAPS2 sit on the computer you learn how to type but you also learn informational site. I also agree because you might family you havent seen in forever and you can go online and talk to them. When you know you can make a routine like you say okday I getfrom school do my homework, go take snower go on the computer for about a hour and a half then go out side and play around or go explore or go for a walk or something. I understand people do stay on the computer fo a long time, but some people rather sit there and gain wait but that's them. They do what the please. And even when people are on the computer they can be looking up new ways to lose wait. You never know what they are doing. They teach you hand-eye coordination. Yeah I understand that and I can relate to it to I used to always look at the keyboard its just like a video game controller you have to memorize all of the buttons and where they are if you think about it like that then you'll end up typing faster and faster. @CAPS2 I get to get going.",7
280,"Computers definitly benefit society. Computers are becoming the number one source of news and entertainment. Some experts believe computers are not good because it keeps them from doing things such as talking with friends and family, and keeps people from excersizing. They are wrong because computers have programs that let you talk to your family and friends, such as @CAPS1. It allows you to send text messages with each other. Also, new computers have equipment inside of it and you can video conferance with someone. You can talk to the computer and the person you want to talk to can see and hear you. The internet has all kinds of nature photos on it. You can search want you want to see, and before your eyes, it is there. Although it would be better to see the outside world up close, with a touch of a button, you can see things that are halfway across the globe. Take @LOCATION1, for example. It is a long flight to get there, and is probally expensive. If someone who likes excersize has a computer, they can buy equipment. Finaly, computers help your hand eye coordination. If you are on the web looking for information, and you find a link to what you are looking for you won't have to worry about moving the mouse in the wrong direction. To sum up, computer are an essential piece of technology. They let you communicate with your friends and family, allow you to see nature, and raises your hand-eye coordination",8
281,"Imagine living in a world without any computers; @CAPS1 things would be so much tougher, people would be wasting paper, and we wouldn't be able to communicate like we do now. The computer is a very helpful resource, a conserver, and a good way of communication amoung friends, family, business, and more. First of all, computers are very helpful to every single person in this world because it's full of knowledge. I can tell you everything about anything. A lot of people would disagree with having computers because the claim that it makes you dumb, but when you really think about it, it gives you so many more answers than a textbook would. Next, computers save trees by having people send emails instead of writing letters or taking tests online instead of giving everyone a paper. People also say that people need to get out and enjoy nature, well you can't really enjoy nature when there aren't any trees left. Also, just to make the paper causes for polution in the air because paper is made at factories, so with a computer you would be saving more than just trees, you would be going green and saving the earth. Last but not least, computers help people communicate all around the world at any time. It even allows you to see someone even if they are miles away or even in a different continent. Theres oovoo, facebook, myspace, etc., they all give you a way of communicateing without having to drive to that persons house. In conclusion, computers help people and the earth in a lot of ways, like helping researchers, saving nature, and helping people communicate to their loved ones. So when people say they disagree with computers, I remind them that its only here to help and make life easier for everyone.",8
282,"What do I think about people spending too much time on the computers and not exercising often? Well, i'll tell you what think about it. I'm not saying it's bad you just need take a break from it. Excersise is good for you your active & playfut it's real fun. To begin, you should plan how long to stay on a computer. So for example @NUM1 - @NUM2 hrs. plan a schedule what websites you want to go on. Say you want check your email for @NUM3 or @NUM4 minute if you have a lot. The play computer games for @NUM5 mins. After your going to type a report that might take you an hour, your finished now! Next, you can play and excersise. The sports play are baseball, basketball, football, soccer, dodgeball, and many more. Or the games you can if you don't like sports frisbee, catch, footrace, hide and seek and more. These activties can give a break from the computer. Finally, there is one more way you can spend time off the computer you can go out with you family to the movies, waterpark, restaurant, road trip, and more. It gets your off of unimportant stuff. It's relax",7
283,"Local newspaper, I am concernd about the amount of kids that use the internet. With your help will decress this number. Imagin you are a @NUM1 year old kid that has problems in school, with many people. The intrenet is just another way. Those kids can bully you. This bullying is called cyber bullying. This kind of bullying can get you into serious trouble if the things you say are. The cyber bullying number has incressed rapidly through the past @NUM2 years. In @DATE1 the cyber bullying number was @PERCENT1 of kids school. Now in @DATE2 its gone up to @PERCENT2 of. You being newspaper care. For I will be talking about exercise. Exercise has been a big topic in the last few years because of obesely. Kids become obese because they play video games on the computer more than taking a jog outside, or kicking a soccer ball around. Im not saying kids shoud stop playing video games but video games should be a a week tops. I personaly love to be outside playing soccer but most kids dont. At @ORGANIZATION1 they took a test, this test shows that a weight kids average day is, go to school, go home, play on computer, secred activity for a hour then more computer me away. My last butt certinly not least is the safty of the internet. Many people go on chat rooms. These chat rooms are with total strangers that the computer choses. Some of these people say they are @NUM3 year old girl but you never no. These people @MONTH1 learn your information if you tell them and can track you down. Another thing about the internet is anything you put on the internet will never be erased. Those are my reasons why internet is bad. Thank you.",8
284,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I am writing this letter for you to state my opinion or what computers do to @CAPS1 and yourself. Have people notice what computer are doing? Computers are taking away it alot of to things. There good for the news but when yo do able of other stuff like play video games it gets addicting. I know this first hand because I use to be addicted too. It takes away the fun stuff. You spend less time with family and friends. You don't excersise as much and you can't enjoy nature or a computer! Don't get me wrong, computers are handy but you should only spend little time on them. They have some advantiges like learning about faraway places with a click of the mouse. They're good for planning a vacation with family and friends. I mean looking at sites, finding hotels and more. BUT, like I said before its hard to pull youself off the computer once you've saw something you liked. Computers also take away social skills. I talking about online dating. You're not interacting with people in a face to face. Also same of these online websites have predators. They will seem trustworthy until the find out where you live then they'll kidnap you, then rape you, then most likely kill you. Do you want this to happen to you?! I'm no, would you want this to happen to you're children? Let me guess, same answer. So stay off the computer as much a possible.",7
285,"I actually think that computers are good for people. I think this because cmputers give you a lot of information. Say that you are doing a social studies project on @LOCATION1 and you need alot of detail on it you need a flag what its goverment is like and much more stuff like that. The computer is an excellent way of gettig alot of accurate information about what you are researching. Also it is good for just relaxing and playing games when you have free time. Also I dont really follow about what theyre saying about people are spending too much time on their computer for example theyre not exercising, enjoying nature or interacting with family or friends for the family and friends because on the internet you could talk with your family, say they are on vacation in @LOCATION2 and they left you alone at your house, you could set up a video link or just write to them, asking them how theyre doing. And the same thing with your friends. And instead of spending youre whole day on a computer do what I do. First you should make a list of whatever you need to be done. Then set a time that you could manage to do all of this. For example during the @DATE1 before my seventh grade year I had a little list that said @NUM1 to @NUM2 eat breakfast @NUM3 to @NUM4 work eat @NUM4 to @NUM6 play my playstation three. For the whole @NUM7 to @NUM8 months of @DATE1 I folliwee this schedule. Then when my dad get home I would go ask him if I could go ride my bike with my friends. Then I would take a shower eat again then I would go on my computer so if everyone had theyre priorities finished before they went on a computer they would have any problems. But overall I think that computers are a very good way of getting research or school work done. Also for chatting with your friends or just relaxing or playing games. Also I really think that it does teach hand eye coordination so when youre typing yuo dont have to keep looking down at the keyboard then back up at the monitor. So this is why I think computers are good for you if you have a well running schedule.",8

287,"Dear Local newspaper. I'm writing this letter to the Local newspaper to give my opinion on the affects computer have on people. I think people can learn in the computers more and more every day. I think is an opportunity for some people to meet other poeple in differents part of the world. People can learn differents cultures on the websites. Is you continue reading I will give you more details on my reason. I think people can learn on the computer because. We can learn about other peoples cultures. People can look for information on the @CAPS1 when they need it. And its good for school projects because you can look for information in the @CAPS1. Thats why people can learn with computers. I said you can learn different cultures because. We can meet people different then us and we can learn about there culture. We can look for websites on the @CAPS1 that has information for different cultures. And we can tock about our cultures on the website. And that is why you can learn different cultures. I said you can meet people because. There are a lot of website that you can meet people. You can chat with people on @ORGANIZATION2, @ORGANIZATION3, @ORGANIZATION1 ect. You see new people every day that wants to be you're friend. And those people can become something for you. You can meet people from around the world. Some times people spend a lot of time on the @CAPS1. but thats there problem because that means that they don't have nothing to do. And I think is good because on a website you can be you're self like if you have a myspace you c an put it whatever you like it. And people should be more responsible. Thanks for reading my letter.",8
288,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are benefical to @CAPS1 society, and helped bring @CAPS1 society to where it is today. It has helped advance technology, communication, and information. Without the computers, @CAPS1 race would not be as fan as it is today. The computer was a great advance in technology, which led to new advances. After the computer was invented, people learned how to make touch screeens for the computers. This was something beyond anyones imagination! With theese computers, restaurants have become tons more efficiant with seating people. Another advance is learning games. Most people think that kids spending a lof of time on the computer was a bad thing. With theese learning games, this is not entirely true kids can learn new things at home and not just at school. Studies show that kids who play theese games at home do @PERCENT1 better in school than at home. Wouldn't you want your kids to do that well in school? This dosen't exactly mean kids should spend all their time on the computer. They should still spend a good amount of time playing outside. Before computers were invented, the only way to communicate with someone was to call them, or write a letter. If we didn't have computers, theese would still be the only way. Calling someone for every little thing you need to tell them could end up costing a lot money. Writing a letter takes time, and even more time for the person to get it. With computers has came email. Your email gets sent to your friend in less than a minute, and is free of cost. You can send documents to people that would normaly cost money to ship from fedex or @ORGANIZATION3. Furthermore, with inventions likes @ORGANIZATION2, all you need is a webcam and you can video chat with somebody for free. Now instead of visiting relatives every time you want to or have to see them, you can vidieo chat with them. One of the greatest inventions that came from the computer is the internet. This is one of the things that has made humans smarter. You can get accurate, up to date information on the internet. An encyclopedia isn't always up to date and cannot update information daily like the internet. Although people believe that you should spend more time outdoors than on the computer, the internet can help you to get outdoors. You can look online for vacation spots, and plan your vacation on the internet. @PERSON1, a mother of four says, ""@CAPS1 last few trips, we use the internet to plan @CAPS1 vacation, and they were the best trips we have had."" People will argue that kids spend, too much time on the computer and not enough time playing sports or exercising. With new awarness of this, there are computer adds everywhere advising kids to go outside. Computers are bennefical to @CAPS1 society and helped bring @CAPS1 race to where we ar today. Without computers, wheve would we be today? ",10
289,"Some @MONTH1 think that computers are no good for your brain or what not, but I beg to differ. I believe that computers can actually emprove your brain function because it works on your hand-eye coordination and also enforms you on any subject you can posibly think of. It also allows you to communicate with family and friends. People say that sitting in front of that computer screen is just wearing you away, but what they might not know is that it can improve your hand eye coordiantion. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of people use a computer tend to have better hand-eye coordination than someone that doesn'@CAPS1. There is also brain games you can play on the computers to not only be entertaining but also work out your brain function and educate you at the same time. You might think that you can'@CAPS1 get anything out of using a silly computer but the truth is you can learn anything imaginable on the computer. You find out things from centeries ago, say on any war or historical event, to your favorite book that just resently published. it can also enform you on the local news incase you missed the news on @CAPS1.V. You want to keep in contact with friends or family more often, well if you had a computer, you can do so. Theres all kinds of ways to keep in contact from aim, to myspace, to facebook. You can instant message or email anyone of you choose. So you can the excuse well I couldn'd get in contact because if you have a computer than you could at any time. To conclude my statement I feel that a computer can give a positive effect on people.",8
290,"Dear local newspaper, More and more people use computers but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I don't agree with the thinking that we are spending too much time on these computers and time enjoying nature and with family and friends. My first reason why i don't agree with in because you would not about far away places and people. My second reason is because the computer allowed you to talk to friends and family that don't live new you. Third is because without computer technology we wouldn't be able to learn at much. Computer technology is very important without it as you can see many of especially studies teachers wouldn't be able to learn much and teach as much about many places and people. It is very important to know about different places and cultures because when we grow up we wouldn't know many things about cultures. By using the computer and learning about places it @MONTH1 be one of the places we might want to visit when we grow up. This is the first reason why i don't agree with the experts. My second reason why i don't agree with the experts is because the computer to talk to friends and family. Its always important to keep in touch with family and friends that don't live near you that way you know how they are doing. By using the internet you @MONTH1 even new friends and get to know more people. There are many days when people are bored so they just go on the computer and chat. Although you wouldn't know who the real person you're with is it's good to have a good time talking to them. My last reason why i don't agree with the experts is because without computer technology we wouldn't even have computer classes. No matter if you are using the computer you are still exercising your fingers the keyboard and processing is for. In school we do many projects in computer that help us learn about people cultured or article life. This my last reason on why i don't agree with the experts. I have explained three reason why i don't agree with the exports thinking that we are spending too much time on our computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and entercating with family and friends. My three reasons were that by using the computers we got to learn about far away and people, we also get to talk to friends and family that don't live and we also get to learn more with them then without computer tech. I hope the experts change their minds.",8
291,"Dear Newspaper, This is a very exciting prompt. Most people agree that those who support advances in technology believe that computers have position effect on people. They tech hand-eye coodinations it give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas some experts are concerned that people are spending to much time on the computers and less exercising, doing homework, enjoy nature and spending time after school or in a program. We need to resolve this issue because people give the ability to learn about faraway places and people. Withou no doubt, why do you think people like going online? For example, @PERCENT1 of people rather stay on myspace, facebook, and yahoo. What do you think people do on these computers? Furthermore, what do you think the computer effect half of these kids? Well its only one way we can solve the issue parents of your child you need to turn you computers of because they spending more time on a computer than school, exercising, homework. @PERCENT1 as these parents allow they kids to talk online to people. Well know you know that @PERCENT1 of your kids like being online talking there friends and family. I really enjoy writing this letter to my local newspaper because this is like interesting to me I will help some of you parents out by telling you about what some experts are concerned of doing on these computers why they is online.",8
292,Dear local newspaper my opinion are that it is good to have computer and it's also bad. Computers are a very advances technology. The reason why I think that computers are good is cause you could do a lot of sotf on them the reason why I think computers are also bad is cause there are bad people that could try to do something to you. My first reason is that computers are very good cause they are a very advances technology they also have a positive effect on people . They also have teach hand - eye and coordination. Another reason is ability to learn new things. You could also learn about faraway places and people. It even allows people to go online and talk to other people. The reasons why I don't think computers are good for people is cause they are spending too much time on their computers. and less time exercising enjoying nature. Another reason is interacting with family and friends. And cause there always be dad people that want to do hamre. Those are the things I think about computers.,7
293,"Dear: Newspaper: Computers maybe addicting but they help people lear easyer, they even help people with some disabilities. They also help people socialize with friends they also help get homework done. Computers also help adults with billing and help kind jobs that pay lots of money, and computers are great for children of all ages. Some websites are edecaltional and some are built for fun!!! You cant do any of this without one. I know these things because I use one all the time at home my whole family uses one my cousins mu relitives even my friends it is not good to use it all the time though sometimes it to talked and exercise. Without computers in the world a tone of things would be really really hard to do. If you ever go to get one go for the cheepest price and be really full with it.",7
294,"Computers are used all the time. Some people think that we spend way to much time on them, and others think that they have a possitive effect on people. I think they have a positive effect because on computers you can learn, find out about places you've never heard, have fun, and you can even talk to relatives. There are so many things to learn, and computers have so much information. It you are having trouble with any of your school subjects, the internet has answers and explanations. Many people go to college online. It is much easier, and you do the same things you would have to do in the class. Learning how to type is very important. Many jobs need people who can use a computer. The computer has information on all states, cities, and towns. You can go online and learn everything on a place. After learning about the place you might even want to visit. There are also many places online to meat new people. You can make a best friend, online who can become your best friend in the real world. If you don't know alot about a specific holiday, or culture, the internet can help you with that too. The computer has many games also. There are so many to choose from and their fun. It's easy to talk to frends online. You can talk to them about anything and you don't have to pay a phone bill. If you have fmaily members that live far away, or dose, you can talk to them online too. If they live far away then you don't have to pay for a long distance call. If you have a webcam you can even see the person you're talking too. As you can see, computers do alot. The help us learn, meat new people and places, and have computers have a possitive. effect on people, or a negative effect on people?",8
295,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, A socioty where men and woman, girl and boy all sit at a pointless screen and store. These addicts, yes the computer is a drag, maybe out of shape, obese, or even worse their life in peril! My dream is to make sure that the regular faimily home wont be sitting in a chair, but playing outside in the fresh air. As you might of geussed, I know that computers will weaken familys and their health. Computers are handcuffs keeping me inside wich sustains me from getting outside. Computers are the greates distractions from family and friends, leading to bad relationships. Finaly these usless boxes trap you at home not in the world where we can help the enviorment. This and the following I hope will help you understand that we should just throw the box in the trash and get on with our lives. More exersize is needed to sustain a healthy body. Experts from sports ihs strated say that @PERCENT1 of computer users don't get the @NUM1 hour of daily exersize they need. Good exersize is @CAPS4 to sustaing a healthy and risk free body. I know for myself that browsing the web kept me from browsing the streets to gain exersize. I was addicted to the computer and soon become sick. Recent studys shows that over @PERCENT2 of paintants in the hosipital have been caused by computer-related brain damage or exsersire obesely. This clearly shows that throwing out the computer would help all our lives. The computer sible @NUM2 freinds and my mother from me. How? I become addicted and they gave up on me. The computer will distract you more than the love of your life. It is a proven study that over @PERCENT3 of computer users have lost at least one relative of friend. Using the computer takes you away from social : @CAPS5 thing from partys, wedings, or even dinner at your home! The addiction will clearly take someone close to you, trust me. Not many help the enviorment, but shows that @PERCENT4 of the people who don't comit to help out world are addicted to these shaddy machines. Helping the enviorment is key to make us alive, but computers just speed up the process of the earths death. I know their are websites that promote the enviorment but most users, just look at the computer and don't do anything! This needs to stop if we want to save our world. As you can see these usless, or even perilos machines must be shut down. less exersize means more people in the hospital. Like computers do anything to help the family sitution.",9
296,"Computers are fountain or knowledge in which the human race has drank from for many years. Some argue that computers are not food for society but they are wrong became they don’t look at the big picture. Computers help society in many ways, two main ways is that it promotes social life and it in as easy way to obtain knowledge about anything in the world. Computers promote social life through ""chat sites"" and other things of the sort. Some popular chat sites are @CAPS1, chatterbox, and chitchat. These sites allow you to talk to your friend without having to waste money and minutes on the phone. Chat sites also help you make more frienfs through friend finder applications. recent studies show that @PERCENT1 of people on chat sites make more than @NUM1 friends per month! There are also other kinds of chat sites such a @NUM2 where you can find the love of you life! When my mother was @NUM3 she met her husband through @NUM2 and now we live in a castle with a. It is clear that computers social life but they are also on easy way to obtain knowledge. Computer, are an easy way to obtain knowledge for many reasons. Through the computer at a click of a button you can know all about the catastrophee of @CAPS2 @CAPS3 fun @CAPS4 @LOCATION1 even if you weren't alive at the time! When my brother had to do a project on the flying spaghetti monster he went to the computer and at the click of a button started reading up on the religion straight away. Recent tests show that @PERCENT2 of people that we a computer for research get it more efficiently and in a timely manner than those who don't. Through the computer one is able to find out the weather and other happenings is the world. It is clear that the computer is an easy way to obtain knowledge and help people with research. It is made from the mind that computers do help society through promoting social life and by giving all easy way to obtain knowledge.",8
297,"@DATE1 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, I remember when my cousins first moved to @LOCATION1. We were concerned that we would lose touch. The four of us were always close. So, when @CAPS5 happened. We no longer needed to worry about drifting apart. That is why computers have a positive effect to the public. Surely you've heard of online communities, such as @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and @CAPS7. These websites allow you to connect with people you @MONTH1 not always see. Certainly that helps people who have moved away up to date with friends and family. When someone has that closeness they feel happier. This general happiness leads to a better society. Secondly, computers are educational. By using them you can develop a more advanced hand eye cordination skill. Another example is that computers help you do research. If you have a science fair project, a computer makes research easier. @ORGANIZATION2 helps millions of people everyday. Yet another reason is that computers can be very useful. Like stated earlier, they assist you in doing research. Also, using this technology can help organize your documents. Essays can be written on programs like @ORGANIZATION1. Certainly that would help in school. To conclude, computers are positive technology for society. Social networks unite families. Research is made easier for everyone. Lastly, they simply help you. This is why I say that modern technology is a wonderful gift to society.",8
298,"I think that computers have a good effect on people for many reasons. First, they teach hand eye coordination. Next, they give people a easier way to learn about far away places. Lastly, they alow people to talk online to other people. First, computers teach hand eye cordination because using a mouse dose it. Also, as simple as it sounds, using hand eye coridnation is very important. Hand eye condnation is a skill that is nearly impossible to live without. @PERCENT1 of people say that computers help with hand eye cordination. Some computers also have special games just to improve hand eye coridnation. Plus hand eye coridination helps you with many things like; sports, school, and even basic everyday stuff like throwing something away. Another reason why computers are important is that it gives people opportunities to learn about far away places and people. Having computers is like having a world wide history, science, and math book at you finger tips. When I mforgot something at school. I know I always had my computers so that I could upload my assiment. In my school we are learning about @LOCATION1 and with computers we were able to look up everything from what kind of food they are to were they would hold secret meetings. Computers help us study and learn about other country's easily. Lastly, computers alow people to talk to other people online @PERCENT2 of teens they talk to all theyre friends online. Having the ability to talk to other people online is a very good luxuary. Other countries are still trying to develope the software to even make computers and since we have already done all that why take them away? Plus being able to talk to jeny so you can get the homework you missed will really help. So in conclusion, having computers is a privelege that we should take advantage of. They teach hand eye coridnation, give people the ability to learn about faraway places, and people, and even alows people to talk to one in other. I demand that computer stay a positive use of line and are continued to be used the right way.",9

300,"Dear Local @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I heard you guys are talking about how people spend to much time on the computer than excercising, enjoying nature, spending time with familys and friends, I think that is wrong to but let me tell you three reasons why it is good to spend time on the computer. The three reasons are why it is good to spend more time on the computer, what does the computer do to your study's and how the computer helps you in life. It is good to spend more time on the computer because a lot of people around the world even adults use computers to help search for websites on the computer for their needs and kids search for games or even history on the computer for their school work or to just spend time looking at the pictures. Thats why kids spend more time on the computer than spend time outside or with their parents. Parents got to understand that the computer is to study and raise for a living not to play games, if the kids spend so much time on the computer playing games than fine you can complain take then off the computer and tell them thats enough computer for one day but if there doing something interesting like geographics way on the internet or then you can let them go and enjoy helping them or just watch and see what they are doing on the computer, so if they need you can help them with stuff. The computer is for studys not for games the computer is a high technology system to help us with our needs. The computer is good for studys and if you are complaining about the time they are spending on the computer then let them go because you should if they are playing or just studying for a project or a quiz because the computer will help them in life and if you take that a way from them then they will struggle when they get to high school or even collage. I suppose so thats why you parents should let them study on the computer than you helping them you might say some answer wrong they check on the internet they don't know wich one to believe so let them by themselves it willbe easy work for you parents out there. The computer helps you in life by giving you the education for the real world when you go to work a computer then they might think he is a smart guy on the computer than the parents will be proud so thats why the computer is important. So I think the local @CAPS1 letter should take this saying underedvisment for you.",9
301,"Dear, local newspaper, I am writing to you because I've recently heard that experts are concerd that people arent spending time outside enjoying nature. Also not interacting with family and friends. And they computers are no good but I disagree with this some kids like myself go on the computer to find fun group games to play outside. Some people who dont have computers still dont exercis or go out side. And my last reason I disagree is because some people dont live near any one in there family so they use the coumpter to keep in contact. My first reason why I disagree with the expers that say people with computers dont exercisi or go outside is, many kid like me and my sister get board easily. So we go on the computer and look up fun games we can play outside with the kids in the neighboorhood. I have a computer and I spend most of my time outside play fun games. Most people dont have computers and most likley they dont exercisi either, would you agree? My second reason why i disagree with experts is some people dont have a computer and they dont go outside. They would rather watch some show on tv. Then play outside in the sun running around playing with other kids. Its not just computers it tv, movies, dvds, cds all the games system they beep them inside. But many people need coumpters also. Local newspaper my third reason why i dont agree with experts when they say they don't interacts with friend or family is because some people dont live by family or some friends have moved away. Newspaper you @MONTH1 not know this but some people have cameras on the coumpter and you can talk to some while looking at them and you dont have to type and it better to see a friend/family member then just hear these voice. These are my three reasons why i disagree with the experts. Get game ideas, some people dont have one and still dont go outside, family easier to talks to an compter so please local newspaper agree with me on this computer subject.",9
302,"Computers are one of the worlds most important peices of technology. They benefit our lives in many ways, but yet some people don't think that. I am not one of them. Computers are a great peice of technology because you can learn more easily, talk with your friends, and you can get things you want easier. Computers make learning much easier. Now most of our textbooks for school are online. Now students don't have to worry about forgetting books at home, or lugging around @NUM1 + pound backpacks. Also, for people who aren't in school, you can look information up online. This not only saves you a trip to a library or book store, but would also save money on gas or the cost of a book at a bookstore. That is how computers make learning easier. Computers are also useful because you can talk and socialize with your friends easier. You can show your friends pictures with the click of a button, that normally they would have to go to your house to see. You can also go into chat rooms with several of your friends. This saves the time of calling each friend individually when trying to make plans or sharing info. That is how computers make socializing with friends easier. Finally, because of computers, we can get things we want a lot easier. Suppose there is a item you need to replace in your home, but no stores have the one you want in stock. Instead of going through the hassel of going from store to store searching for it, you can just hop on your computer and select from thousands of choices. You can also save money, because often internet prices are cheaper than the store's price. You also don't have to worry about large items fitting in your. The item will be delivered to your home, and you can even get assistance to set it up. How convienient is that? Computers are a great convienience. Even though they @MONTH1 keep us away from nature, we have to make that choice ourselves computers are great because they make learning easier, make socializing easier, and make getting things you want easier. They basically make like a whole lot easier.",9

So if you know someone that does that all to much do your best to help them before its to late! Now a days I think that they are all just on those computers and are emailing, or I.M.ing, or playing some stuiped computer games. I also strongly beleive that they are doing less homework and there grades are going down little by little and now shcools might be strugling now because of that. I also think that the websites are bad like addikting games, all they have is curses and gun's. even more than @PERCENT1 of the school distrect plays the games. Computers have only brought are socity down little by little leaving some of us blank. To learn more stay on your computer and in no time you will go blank, and before you know you are never going to get off your computer and you will never see the world agein.

304,"Four out of five people in the world own a computer. Computers are becoming part of human civilization. Many experts are concerned that people are spending to much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. People are becoming adicted to computers. Therefore, people are spending to much time on computers and not exercising. Almost @NUM1 out of @NUM2 @CAPS1 are obease. These people don't go out and excercise. Obeasity is a major problem affecting many people. When people spend time on computers they become addicted and don't want to go out to excersise. Excersising at least @NUM3 hours a day is essentional for a human body. Being on a computer for too long can damage the way people think. Studies show that @NUM4 out of @NUM5 people that spend everyday on a computer are not able to concentrate. Computers can also damage the ability to see. Many people have told you not watch t.v. up close but whats the difference with looking at a computer up close. Light that comes froma computer goes directly to the humans eye. This can damage a persons carnia ( a layer over the eye) and make it harder for people to see. All though people have computers, computers shouldn't be used a lot. There are so many wonders in the world. For instance the worlds nature. People miss out on this because they are to bessy on doing work home on their computers. Now people can e-mail work from work to home. People get distracted and never take a vacation. With on week someone can visit another country and get to know it. Nature helps calm down a person from to much stress just like yoga does. Statistices show how people can calmthemselves from just getting to know a place that is natures. People that spend time on their computer look at pictures from other places instead of visiting the place. Not only are computers pulling people away from nature but also from their family and friends. Two out of three people live far away from their family. Computers are getting people distracted from getting together as a family. On computers people can chat but what if the other person doesn't know how to write or read. Visiting is a better way to get to see a family member. You get to see them personally and remember their faces. When you have a friend you usually get seperated during college. During college brake you can visit a friend to know what is happening and what charged. No matter how computers become it wilol never be better than a human. Life might be cheaper is you spend it on computers. Instead of paying a trip you can talk on the internet and instead of paper you can save it on a hard drive. Computers aren't everything in the world. Before computers were invented families were closer and had a better relationship also people knew the contrymone. I hope people react and spend less time on their computers. There are many beauties in the world that humans are ment to see so don't spend it on an electronic that can hurt you.",11
305,"Dear, Newspaper company I believe people should spend less time using computers and more time with their family, when your on the computer all day you don't get enough exercise, and you can attract online predators. Spending time with your family is valuable because you can share how your day went, what was new in your life and how you are doing academicly. But when your on the computer all day you can't enjoy any of those things because you are to concerned whats on that monitor. You can miss out on whatching movies, going to exciting places, and even parties because you are to busy playing games on the computer. When your on the computer all day you can miss the thing that really make you happy. Exercise is very important in a healthy life style but do you get exercise when your eating chips and chating with a friend? I didn't think so. When you don't exercise you can become obese. Twenty percent of kids that spend more than an hour on the computer are obese and don't get enough exercise. When you spend hours on end using the computer it cant be healthy. Also when you use the computer to much you can end private chat rooms. You can meet people that are friends but you can met people who pretend to be your friend. The people are called online predators. They pretend to be your friends and if you believe them for too long they can ask you if you want to meet. This is a very bad mistake because if you go you can be abducted or kidnapped. So dont meet someone without telling a parent or gaurdian. Because you can be abducted. When your in a chat room you have no way of knowing of the person when you are talking to is really your friend or someone who wants to hurt you. And if you spend less time on the computer you can mind the chances of happening to you. So dont let your life pass gone by and spend time with your family, get exercise and stay away from chat rooms if you really know who you are talking to. These are the three of many reasons why you should spend more time with your family.",8
306,"Dear @LOCATION2 @CAPS1 editor, @CAPS2 residents here in @LOCATION2, @STATE1 are split between whether or not advances in technology @CAPS2 have a positive or a negative affect on @DATE1's society. However, I strongly agree with those who have stated advances in @DATE1's technology are crucial for even survival. To test this, computers can allow for communication with others, further education, and even teaching hand eye coordination. To begin, in most cases, relatives and friends @MONTH1 live far away from same citizens. They can't constantly visit or call each other every - day. @CAPS8, what do they do? Easy solution: each person hops onto the couch, grabs their @CAPS3 computer, opens @CAPS4, and chats away. Similarly, I have relatives and friends who live in @LOCATION1, @CAPS8 I don't always see them. Without computers, I wouldn't be able to talk to my best friend @PERSON2, or my cousins @PERSON3 and @PERSON1. Thanks to @CAPS5, an instant messager website, and @CAPS4, we wouldn't be able to keep up with what happens daily in each other's lives. Also, @PERCENT1 of most @CAPS7 use the computer to talk with their family and friends daily. Apparently, computer usage for talking with friends and family was become a necessity. In addition, computers are required even for education. @DATE1's students of @LOCATION3 are basically all using computers for online college courses, (like my brother @PERSON4 who goes to @ORGANIZATION1), help with homework, and even for researching places around the world, like @LOCATION4, for that history assignment are next week. A teacher at @ORGANIZATION1 said, ""In @DATE1's world @CAPS2 colleges are too far away and @CAPS2 students don't want to travel too far away. @CAPS8, they just go online to our website and type away at all of their essays and tests and quizzes.""@CAPS8, computers are the most turned to device for educational research and homework topics. Finally, there are educational games on websites such as, pbskids.org, for yourger children to teach them hand-eye coordination, and subjects to get them @CAPS9-@CAPS10 ready such as learning to count and singing their ""@CAPS11's"". Teaching these subjects is important because the younger the kid is that you hach, the more likely they are to grasp the subject and continue to learn more efficiently. to conclude, advances in @DATE1's technology (computers) is a necessity for all learning and future education. @CAPS8, what are you waiting for? Grab your @CAPS3 or @ORGANIZATION2 laptop or even your bell computer and let's get educated!",11
307,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 are very beneficial to our society. They help us with Hand-eye coordination, Allow people to learn about for away places, and if a sibling or friend is away places, and it a sibling or friend is out of town. No problem you can talk online. Hand eye coordination is very helpful it makes it easier to type for those monster papers you hear all about from college students. It also makes it easier to play sports like baseball or football. Have you ever tried to catch a baseball without your eyes and hands coordinating? It's like trying to catch a scared grease pig, almost impossible. Sewing requires lots of Hand eye coordination so when your in @CAPS2-@CAPS3 you'll be glad you took those computer lessons. With @CAPS1 you can go anywhere with @ORGANIZATION2 you can visit steamy @CAPS4, @PERSON1 beaches, and the tallest peak of any mountain. You learn about everything and just at the click a mouse. When you have to get information for an essay paper where do you go? Thats right your computer you find out everything there. Can you imagine teachers used to look things up in books. Now all you need to do is type in you search term and click enter. Easy as pie. When your friend is out of town or your parent or sibling don't you wish you could talk to them. Well you can just go to you video laptop and get on there and talk away. Don't you hate it when you forget to write down a piece of @CAPS5 well now instead of missing that huge @CAPS5 assignment. Just get on your email and ask a friend. Don't you get tired of hearing your parents yell at you for their telephone bill. Well not anymore you can chat with a friend to meet up for sodas anytime now. So obviously @CAPS1 are very important you learn Hand eye c coordination, you learn about places every where and you can talk to familey and friends anytime, anywhere.",8
308,"Dear @CAPS1, I am writing to inform you about the issue we are all having questions about on computers. I am a student, however, I do understand how much useful computers can be to future generations. The internet allows us to gain world @CAPS2, allows interaction with family and friends from different place, and it's a great source for education. I hope that after reading this letter, you will agree with me not only as a student but as adult as well. Computers are not only used for games and fun or even chatting with friends but it give future adults the world @CAPS2 they need to gets good jobs, maybe even form alliances with other countries. As a student, I often use the internet to provide me resource on whats is happening all over the world, not only about what is happening on the state or around @LOCATION2. Going to sites like @CAPS3.com, @CAPS4.com, etc gives everybody on edco or  of what different countries are having a crisis about or how they are building good with neigboring countries, even with @CAPS5.S.D the international headlines are a key source of @CAPS2 that does appear on some the internal vast varily of what is happening currently or live in the world with, headlines and even more without would @CAPS2, we can brights only for but, adults today can a different the world, whether it's sharing being of author ; it makes is huge is pool. The internet not only allows us to gain world @CAPS2 but entertain. My father always gets currently through the computer they get to email each other and have some good times; it's the only way my father with her friend. people all around the world want to know about how their mother, father, aunt, uncle, etc are on another country or province. Recently in the news, it @CAPS6, @LOCATION1 interacting with @CAPS7 with the the internet. We get to @CAPS8 they are doing okay and it satisfied the close family and friends knowing that @CAPS9 can be used always in there are must keep our relationship strong and ; we have to use the internet for emmile or computer compare to internet will lives around the world. The last reason, the internet is very useful us for purposes. Computers allows people and to and to school. For handle there are used for accounting, kerring chorts and graphs. It allows us to do things than the hard way things. more efficiently and with accurate information work and projects are also done finished. In conclusion, it can be sad that with the it makes work much. It allows us to gain world @CAPS2 information with family and friends and for education purposes. PS you have it will make your country and future a bright. I hope that after reading this letter you @MONTH1 hopefully agree with my opinion.",10
309,Dear Newspaper I think about computers more people use the computers everyday but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Because those who support advances in technology believe that computres have a positive effect of people and I think that is true because some people use the computers all day they don't do nothing only in the computer some childrens use the computers but they talk with others people they don't know who is them the childrens have a problems with the eyes because they are only in the computers and that effect yours eyes. Another things is the childrens met with other people in the computer but they don't know who is them that person want too met each other then that children go to that they don't know who is them that person adapted that children they can use the violence with that children they can call to the parents and say if they give don't money your children can died and that is the more problems in the world with the childrens or in the family. I agree with other people they can use the computer @NUM1 minutes or less but not all day I think the parents can do to go out with childrens going to the park others thing but not in the house and all dau in the computers I think that all the problems we have with the computers with the family and I think you too think the so please think that think about happen to the childrens and other people and peolple thing taht too they think is most better the do that to the family think that what I say effects to others people to use the computers all day please only think what I say.,8
310,"Almost every family has a computer in their house lots of kids spend a lot of time on the computer, and not outside. Adults are also on it trying to email each other. People are on computers to much. Mostly teens are on the computers. They are always checking facebook or are playing games online. Those kids are on the computer and are not trying to exercise. The parents should have a time limit for the kids on the computer. They should be alward to use it if they need to look something up for school. Other wise they need to be outside running or out with friends. Kids are not the only people spending hours on the computer. Adults are on it too. They are emailing each other and seeing if they want to go out for dinner. Adults are also on dating websites. The looking at pictures and people profiles. Not that is on these websites. Some people need time off of the computer go outside play a game of football with their friends or just go play a game of poker to get off the computer. Computers can make people forget about exercise. All they care about is taking to their friends on facebook or going on the online dating. Many people are not exercising and are sitting on the computer all day. If everyone. like the whole country would be obease. Computers need a time limit on them. Once you are on to cons then it will shut down and there is nothing you can do about it. Those are some ideias about why computers are not good. Rember do you what your country to go obease.",7
311,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 would you guys feel if your child was being cyber bullyed on the computer, or mabey someone you love such as a husband, wife or or a big brother or sister was now addicted to certain things on the computer because thats all they want to do? Well, I believe that many americans bday are even turning obese because of the computer, which is why I strongly believe the man made computers have negative effect on many people, for the reasons placed above. In todays life, the average american sits on the computer for about @NUM1 hours per week. This is not only bad for our health, it can lead to cyber bullying. Studies show that over @NUM2 americans are cyber bullied every month. This in turn can caused chain reaction that can lead to . For example, in @DATE1 a @NUM3 year old girl was @PERSON1 bullied on the computer it had and just couldn't take it any. Its easy to see why many with one on the fact computers effect but it is of things. The computer addiction. For example, many ader each the computer to example time passes it @CAPS2 thein to loose. Ther @CAPS3 and became @CAPS4. Their family they will be bery stressed out. @NUM4 out of @NUM5 americans will become obese do to the computer. While they are inside sitting their big buts on the computer the other @NUM6 are going for a walk or jog. Imagine what this will do to the @NUM4 americans in the long run. They will become obese and many internal problems will develop. Obese is one of the killers in america so if computers are contributing to this why do others still argue that we should have them around? It now or never this is the time for you to decide wheather or not computers are good for the human population, keep in mind that it causes addictions, obesity and cyber bulling.",8
312,"These surely is a mixed view of the role that computers have on our society. A lot of people feel that they are something we can not live without. My personal view is that they are hazadous to society because of the lack of exercising, online predators, and lack of own family time. Hey, I say if america thrived without computers, there is no indispotable evidence that it can not happen again. Firstly, computers have given society @CAPS1 excuse to not exercise. I find it add that for the past @NUM1 years, when computers were first released, obesity has risen to such a high level to where it is a national concern. To say that the two are unrelated makes no sense. It's pretty much saying that hey computers have been out for @NUM1 years, land obesity has risen during that time to a very high extent, but obviously the two are not related. As you can tell, that statement make no apparent sense, and again proves that computers are doing more harm then good in today's society, @CAPS1 bad effect computer it has been giving to today's public is the easy access for online predators. Though this @MONTH1 seem a bit extreme, it is an issue that needs to be addressed. On social-networking sites like facebook, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3, where everyone accepts friends requests and can list their hometown, age and gender, it leaves the option for online predators everywhere, and makes it that much easier to be abducted. Also, a new site called formspring allows for anyone to post anonymously on you ""wall"" saying whatever they want. Since you are never sure who is messaging you, it leaves the door open wide for an online predator. The increasing number of child abductions has increased since the creation of computers, again proving computer's dangers. A last reason why computer's are hazardous to society is because it has caused for lack of family interaction. You might be thinking, well i @CAPS4 my cousins everyday, so i'm actually talking more. What i mean is immediate family, mom, dad, siblings. Studies have shown that families are spending less time together. You have kids who play video games all day, eat dinner with their family, and go back to video games. Family ""talk"" time is no more, family game nights have pretty much been terminated, and even family movie night's are decreasing because you can watch whatever you want on your computer with the simple push of a button. The endless possibilites of computers cause for a lack of family time. In conclusion, computers have become hazardous to our society. Though i will admit they are in moderation. For the sake of health, safety and family, computer use needs to be reduced.",10
313,"Dear Newspaper @NUM1 Computers are like a way of life, every person in the world uses them to chat with friends, write papers, and look something up. It was a great technological advancement. Computers make writing faster, the also make talking to friends easier, and they give people something to do. Without computers in our lives people wouldnt have vary much too. Taking away computers will lead to video games being taken away. Computers make our every day life styles a whole lot eaiser, which is why they should stay in our every day lifes. Computers make writing faster @PERCENT2 of people use the computer to write things like reports, or papers says a google survey and my teacher @PERSON1 even says ""without computers the grades would be chaos,"" computers are the answers to many things so therefor @CAPS1 should keep them in our schools, office buldings, and houses. In addition to making writing easier, computers make talking to friends eaiser. If you don't have a friends number you can email them or facebook them and get it from them, even if your a shy person and you want to ask someone got you can do it are the computer. You can also past pics of you an your friends, and do tons of cool stuff. In addition to making writhing faster, giving students the opportunity to chat with friends is great @PERCENT1 of students love the idea and so do my teachers,"" @CAPS1 love to talk to each other and make plans to go out."" @CAPS2 are last reason why computers were a great technological advancement is because what if it was raining and you had nothing to do you could go online chat with friends or even look up videos. When it's raining I usually go on facebook or on itunes as download music, without computers @PERCENT3 of people wouldn't like music as much as they do now say @CAPS3.com my friend lizey even says ""I tunes and facebook are great i don't know what would do without them."" I conclude that computes were a great technological advancement, because of many benefits it has to offer, it makes writing faster, it makes talking to friends easier, and it gives you something to do on a rainy day. I love computers and so do @PERCENT3 of americancs. They were a great advancement and i can't wait to c whats next in store for technology.",9
314,"Dear local newspaper, more and more people are using computers, but not everyone agrees that they benefit society. The use of computers has greatly contributed to the weight issue in @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 cannot find the time to go outside and enjoy the @CAPS3 air, and they almost never see their family or friends. Computers have a negative effect on people and must be used less frequently. First off, computers are a minus for @CAPS1 because they can become addicting and @CAPS1 people do not receive their much needed exersize. A recent study shows that @PERCENT1 of computer users only get about three hours of exersize each week. Which is far below the minumum. in addition, @PERSON2, a children’s physician stated, “@CAPS1 people think that computers are harmless to their health, but actually, when children sit at the computer for hours, fat is building up on their bodies, which quickly leads to obeisity.” @CAPS2, @ORGANIZATION1 displayed an article last week, listing the harmful effects of computer use. They are @CAPS2 on the top @NUM1 list of contributers to weight gain the country. A few minutes turn into hours, and then you are hooked. @CAPS1 never go outside, and don’t get the proper excersize. Although @CAPS1 feel that computers are helpful to society, they have negative effects on the body which can be hurtful. Moreover, computers are a minus because they take up @CAPS1 people’s time, which then does not allow them to go outside and enjoy the @CAPS3 air. Dr @PERSON5, a health specialist has said, “@CAPS3 air and the outdoors are crucial for a growing child’s developement.” @CAPS4 @CAPS3 air, they @MONTH1 grow at a very slow pace, and sadly enough, miss a part of their childhood.” @CAPS5 says that computers are mainly to blame for this issue, and in order to fix it, must be used far less frequently. Additionally, @NUM2 out of @NUM1 adults and children are only outside on an average of two days because they are emailing or using the computer. @PERSON3, a youngman, never went outside except for walking to the mailbox each afternoon. His reason? @CAPS5 was on the computer, emailing , gaming not enjoying the great outdoors. As a result, @CAPS5 grew weak and regreted going outside. One @MONTH1 feel that computers allow the average person to learn of far away places, however, they @CAPS2 take away from their valuable time outdoors. Finally, computers are minus because they take away time to spend with family and friends. CNN.com reported that families in @LOCATION1 are rapidly growing apart due to lack of family dinners and family outings. Reporters point their fingers towards the computers, because this is where @CAPS1 families claim that they spend most of their time. @CAPS2, a recent survey showed that @NUM4 out of @NUM5 friendships are lost over the course of six months because they never see each other outside of school. @PERSON1, an @ORGANIZATION2 school student claimed that she and her friend @PERSON4, didn’t speak for over three months, and never noticed because they were always playing games on their computers after school. One @MONTH1 understand why someone else might think that computers teach hand eye coordination, but really they only destroy strong family bonds and potential @PERSON3 lasting friendships. To conclude, computers have a nasty effect on @CAPS1 across @LOCATION1. They have greatly contributed to the lack of exersize, eliminate time in the @CAPS3 air, and loose family and friend time for @CAPS1. Thse negative effects must be known to the public, as @CAPS1 of them use their computers far too much. Please let the facts be known!",11
315,"I think computer do not allways have a positive affect on people. I think this because some people stay on computers. It is very addicting to them. Using computers to much can also get you into alot of trouble. The final reason is because computers can reveal personal information. Do you think computers are bad? Read on and you will find out my opinion on this topic. I think computer can not have a possitve affect by it bring addicting. Some people actualy say it is there life. When something like this is so addicting it keep people on the computers. Sometime people even stay on the computer all day. The reason this is, is because there is so much you can do on the computer. One day I was watching a show and this women said thats all she does is stay on the computer. Then she had to get off the computer and she told her friend to go on and check her email. The women went on the show and the host of the show (@CAPS1) mad her stop for a while. Then she learned that, that is not the only thing. The second reason why I think computer does not always have a positive affect on people is because it gets people in trouble. There is alot of websites that you can go on to talk to friends that you know and dont know. So sometime people take advantage of the fact that they are allowed to do that. So they deside that talking about people is ""ok"". They can get into allot of trouble for this. Not only in trouble with your parents but legal trouble. If there is any bullying online this is know a ""siber bullying"". This is an affence that can probly go down on your record. This is all the reason that add up to why I think computers do not allways have a possitve affect on people. My reason are because they are addicting to people. The next reason is because it can get people into trouble. What do you think? Is it a possitve affect?",8
316,"Today, I write to the local newspaper in spite of an unresolved issue. Should people be spending as much time as they do on their computer? A computer is a great piece of technology, don't get me wrong. But people are spending too much time on them. Did you know that the overage teen spends @NUM1 minutes outside everyday? That's nothing! If we continue the computer obbsesiveness, then our children could grow up to be lazy, fat, and not willing to do work. Is that what we want? It's almost sad that people will look at places online that are within driving range. If you want to go check out that beauty, then get in your and drive there! Two benefits to going for a hike, or going skating is that you get to spend quality time with for family. Family time is one of the most recommended activities because experts say that it motivates your kids to do better in school and will make them feel good. What kind of parents wouldn't their kids to succeed? Another big issue is that is you have a webcam you don't know what you could be getting your teen or preteen into. They could be going on the internet and showing or finding innapropriate pictures of themselves or others. A good way to stop this is to use parental controls. Your kids could grow up to be just a who sits on his computer all day. It's your choice on this parents of cranby, how much computer time you or your family use. You can make yourselves have fun, going on nature likes or skiing. But if you prefer to look online and get as family time, be my guest. Computers shall be not used as much as before and we will have a better environment.",8
317,"Not everyone will agree with me when I say, ""Computers benefit society."" @CAPS1 this letter everyone will. Computers help you stay in-touch with friends, allow you to use online textbooks, and play games that help your hand-eye coordination. Jump on board as I tell you about the wonderful affects of computers. Everyone knows it is important to have a well rounded social life, and with the computer that is possible. Social networking sites like @CAPS2 allow you to keep in touch with friends what if your brother or sister went off to college? Sure you could talk to them, but being able to video chat with the help of your computer allows interaction to be exciting. Computers have many benefits in and interaction is just one. The @CAPS3 is at a standstill with polution and all the trees that have been cut down to make textbooks. Computers allow the usage of online textbooks; therefore helping us keep trees alive. I would deffinetly use a computer to look through a textbook the kill twenty-three trees for every kid in my class to have a textbook, written on paper. Also many teachers put homework assignments on school websites, so if you forget to write down homework you could use your computer to look it up. Computers help save our environment and kids who might forgot to write down their homework. Nine out of ten people will agree that hand-eye coordination is an important skill to have in life. Computer games allow you this skill. The keyboard or mouse allows your hands to develope movement, and the movements on the screen allow you eyes to develope strength. By putting the two together while playing a game you allow your hands to move what your eyes are looking at. This helps for a great sense of hand-eye coordination. Games on the computer can be challenging and make you have to use your mind also. The computer lets for many skills with just a couple clicks of a mouse. The computer is a very useful piece of equipment in today's society and helps benefit us. It allows for a wide range of interaction between friends and family. The online textbooks help many people save the trees in our planet, and lastly the computer helps teach hand-eye coordination that allows people to use these skills in everyday life. The computer has benefited our society in more ways then one and many people are thankful for that.",10
318,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In this world today many people are either on their computers or outside having a good time. In my opinion, computers do not have a positive effect on people. They will take time out of your day when you could be doing something else. Instead of looking at computer games, you could be outside enjoying nature around you, interacting with people face to face or exercise. In my mind, we shouldn't even have computers. No matter where you live in the world, there is something @CAPS1 unique around you. It is nature. Nature is one thing in the world that never disappears. If you are spending your day on the computer checking emails or playing games you will never get to see everything that @ORGANIZATION2 has to offer. Another reason why you should enjoy nature is because of all the exotic animals and plants you might see. On a regular basis, you wouldn't see them! It would be great if you saw all the fenominal plants and animals. Especially if it is with your family! Although computers give us an e-mail account, I still think that computers are just ruining out time. You coud be talking with someone on your computer but it would be much better if you could meet them in person. You will be able to get to know the person better and later on get to be great friends with them. Another reason why computers affect your social life is because you won't be able to spend time with your family and friends. If you get really close to your family then they will stay at hotels for the holidays and the more they come and stay in @LOCATION1 the more money the town will get to pay for anything the town needs like a shopping center or repairs on the roads. Plus if everyone is on their computer, no one will be outside in the streets shopping and all the stores will be out of buisness and once you need a new pair of shoes, the shoe store will be long gone before you know it. @CAPS1 it is important to stay close to your family and friends. Everybody loves a great game of basketball or a heart-pounding match of tennis. Well how are you going to be a star of you aren't outside practicing. If you are on your computer all day, you won't be abe to exercise and get the things you need to be healthy. Scientists have tested the amount of people overweight and @PERCENT1 of them said that they played on their computers everyday. Do you want that to happen to you. No I didn't think @CAPS1. All of those people wished that they got outside with their friends when they were young. @CAPS1 overweight people won't be able to socially interest with people and that means no money for the town. @CAPS1 if you want to be a fat couch potato keep up playing on your computer but remember what they said. ""I regret this."" @CAPS1 now you have learned that enjoying nature, interacting with people and exercising is important to live a healthy life. If you are playing on your computer the the whole time, you won't make a living with yourself.",10
319,"Take yours eyes of that computer screen and listen for a minute why waste you life @CAPS1 in front of computer screen. When was the last time you ate a healthy meal, went outside, or interacted with family and friends? I can tell by the looks of you that you haven't ate healthy in weeks. Expert nutriest @PERSON2 says ""@CAPS1 in a computer chair eatting junky foods can result in concicenqueces such as death."" @CAPS2 you even know what a threadmill is? My dad wouldn't eat in the morning and then eat pounds of food for dinner, @CAPS3 he got to be really big. Then he exercised and exercised and he lost @NUM1 pounds. That could be @CAPS5 you turn off your computer and @CAPS2 some push-ups. When was the last time you showered? @NUM2? Did you know that @PERCENT1 of the people who shower have a better life. They find parter and get more friends. @CAPS3 be healthy. When was the last time you went outside? All the cool, athletic people are doing some sort of exercise outside like hiking, swimming, and @CAPS4 climbing. Plus who does it hurt to get some fresh air. @PERCENT2 of people who get fresh air are the people who have positive attitudes and get promotions in work. And going out side and exercising can make you live longer. Retired @ORGANIZATION1 pitcher @PERSON1 says,"" @CAPS5 i wasn't a pitcher then i would of been having all kinds of organ failers."" I know that you talk to your family through e-mail and video, but that's not the same as seeing them in person. I can remember when my family from @CAPS6 came to see us. It was on of the best days of my life seeing there @NUM3 little babies and my aunt and uncle. @CAPS2 you spend holidays with your family? That's what makes it the happiest time of the year of course. @PERCENT3 of happy families spend christmas together and they stay out of jail, have wonderful jobs and love each other very much. Have you ever missed a family gathering like a picnic and felt ashame?",8
320,"Dear Local @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 is my belief that computers have less positive effect on people! Spending too much time on the computer encourages less exercizing? no one is outside, enjoying nature? Family and friends are being left out. These are the reasons why computers have a less positive effect on people. Spending too much time on the computer encourages less excerzing. This is why this country is high in obisity levels. People spend more time inside. People are becoming unfit. This is becoming very unhealthy! For the reasons above, computers have a less positive effect on people. No one is outside and enjoying the beautiful nature! A breath of fresh air be more every once in a while! People have animals to walk. Going out side brings less depression. @CAPS3 also bring happiness. For the reasons above these are the reasons why, computers have a less positive effect on people. Family and friends are being left out and forgotten. Spending time with family and friends builds socializing skills. @CAPS3 makes you more friendly. Spending quality time is what everyone needs, especially after a long day. A computer could @MONTH1 replace your family. Also, you could make up for lost times. For the reasons above, computers have a less positive effect on people? In conclusion, computers do bring a less than positive effects on people. Less exxerzing, is one negative effect. Staying inside all day and not being able to go nature is another negative effect. Friends and family are being left out and forgotten. These are the why computers bring a less postive effect on people.",8
321,"Dear Local Newspaper, I think being able to use a computer is a good thing because you can talk to friends and family in diffrent contreys. You can also learn how to use technology. Also, with a computer, reasearching can help you learn about diffrent types of things.Have you ever wanderd how your family was and how they are doing when they are on the other side of the world? Well using a computer and going on msn, aim, or even facebook you can talk to your family and friends. This gives you an opertunity to find out how they are doing, and hows it like. Thats one reason I think computers are good. Using a computer helps people learn on how to use technology. Computers are part of technology. So if you learn to use one it will help you with anything else. Learning to use a computer is one of they easiest things. My last reason is that reaserach on a computer will help you learn a lot. For example you wanna know about @CAPS1. You go on @ORGANIZATION1 and type in @CAPS1, click on a page and read. You will find lots of information. Computers will help you learn alot! I really think computers are helpful because of these reasons, talking to friends family that live in diffrent contreys, learning on how to use technology and reasearch helps learn alot.",7
322,"Dear @CAPS1, I recently read that there is a large controversy over whether or not the use of computers benefits society. I very strongly believe that computers have a positive effect on people because they save trees, allow people to talk online together, and @MONTH1 give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. First and foremost, the use of computers is very green because it saves trees. Many schools have textbooks that are hundreds of pages long and with computers you can access the books online and you wont have to print them anymore. Likewise, many workplaces print thousands of pages of reports everyday, but with computers they can electronically save them and make them accessible to everyone, without printing anything. If you were going to write a letter you would continually have to re-write everytime you made a mistake. However, with computers you can simply make changes without having to re-do the entire letter. Furthermore, with computers there are many different ways to communicate one of the more recent forms of communication over the computer is video-chatting. This is when you can see each other on your computers screen and talk to each other. Also, you can send emails or electronic letters that travel much more quickly than letters. Likewise,  you can ""@CAPS2"" or instant message, which is your similar to texting. Another advantage to using computers is that it is very easy to learn about faraway places and people. My brother had to do a report on a country in @LOCATION1, and he very simply went online and found over one million different websites he could use. You not only can find websites that teach you about the country but you can also find the people or that countries very own websites. Furthermore, you can even learn about places that have disappeared, such as the lost city of @CAPS3. In conclusion, the use of computers has a very positive effect on our society because of how they help us communicate, learn places people and how eco-friendly they are. @CAPS1, some people with an opposing view point @MONTH1 argue that people spend too much time on their computers instead of exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with friends and family. Those people are wrong because you can learn how to exercise on line computer and you can interact with others aswell. The use of computers also teaches hand-eye coordination, a very important skill in life.",11
323,"Dear local newspaper, Computers have recently taken @CAPS1 by storm. The computer has transitioned, and has alserations done to closer its technological perfection. Computers are a quick way to gain knowledge and even purchase items. The computers also an easly accessable communication device. Finally, the computer has numerous programs that can schedule a time period in which you use the computer. Might I say this invention is simply impecable. To begin, the computer is a rapidly quick source to earning knowledge, and even purchasing items. Without a computer @CAPS3 people would have to drive the gasoline powered moter vehicles across country to purchase an important item. Therefor, polluting the planet greatly. Is that what you would like to do to our environment? Computers are a fast way to earning important knowledge. One way is through the very popular search engine ""@CAPS2."" @CAPS3 people search through the @CAPS3 links on the website and almost always find there answer. One the most knowledable can understand that the speed of a computer is a valid reason to believe that the computer is a benefit to society. In addition to being a fast source to knowledge and purchasing items, the computer is an easily accessible communication device. With a webcam attached to a computer a computer transfoms into a virtual telephone. You can physicly see the face of @CAPS3 of your closest friends and family. Yes you call them, but why call when you can see and speak to person you with. A poll was done on every family in @CAPS4 and @PERCENT1 of @CAPS4's own a working computer, and @PERCENT2 of them had a webcam. A mother of two in @LOCATION1 once said ""my children would never get see there father who is currently stationed in @LOCATION2. If it wasnt for our webcam, and computer."" To finalize, the computer comes with programs in which you can schedule time periods where the computers accessible. The programs can shutdown the computer at scheduled times. Therefor you are given an amount of time to participate in nessesary activities such as exercise. Thes programs will leave you with enough time to do what your body requires. Lazy and out of shape people don't use these programs. Yes it doesn't force you to exercise but at that point the choice of exercising or not is up to you. Its very important to use these programs, one reason being without them you will become addicted to your computer and your life will become corrupt. To conclude computers are very benefitial to society. The computer has a very positive effect on people for reasons such as being a fast resource to knowledge, to being a way of communication, and even having programs the shut down your computer at certain times leaving you with ample amount of time to take part in similar to exercising. I want all to do what is best for them and use a computer. Don't be one of the only not smart enough to use one the most inevative, elaborate, inventions to gracefully equipt our society.",10
324,"Dear newspaper, @CAPS1, I read in TIME magazine that there is an arguement over the negative and positive effects of computers. I think computers are good for our society because it gives people news updates, teaches basic skills, and helps people to communicate. Interested about what's going on in the world, many people look towards computers for news updates. @PERSON5, a farm owner in @LOCATION1, live @NUM1 miles from the nearest town. She does, however own a computer without it she would be lost about what's going on. Millions of people would also be unwitting without a computer. @PERSON3, a scientist of @ORGANIZATION2, also feels this way. He conducted a study on dependency on computers and found that @PERCENT1 of people in the @LOCATION3 mostly get news from the computer. Would you like to be in a world where no one knows the news? I wouldn't. With unlimited applications, a computer can easily teach someone a new skill. @PERSON4, a sociology major of @ORGANIZATION1 took a survey around the school and found that people who read from their computer read more often. They also comprehend the information better. Other people also use their computer as a resource for learning. @PERSON6 @CAPS2, a businessman at @ORGANIZATION3 was told to learn how to write letter in cursive or he would lose his job. @PERSON6 immediately went home to his computer and downloaded a software that teaches different types of handwriting. With a new skill, @PERSON6 returned to work the next day and received a promotion. Computers are a fine addition to this world. Stayinhg connected with friends and family is important and using computers is an easy way to do that. @PERSON1, a current student at @LOCATION2, has a very busy schedule. His day consists of classes from @NUM2 am to @NUM3 pm, followed by dinner and @TIME1 study sessions. He is always busy when his parents are free talk. The only way for communication is by emailing. He can respond whenever he has time and his parents are happy to hear from him. When children go off and grow up, communicating through the computers is simple and easy. Furthermore, a recent study by @PERSON2, a specialist on family, showed that @PERCENT1 of people stay connected to their family with computers. These people are happy to hear from their relatives. As you can see, computers enhance many lives around the world by giving news updates, helping with basic skills, and help to communicate with friends and family. Technology is growing rapidly and other electronics @MONTH1 be bad, but computers are helpful.",10
325,"Dear local newspaper I think computers are a good and reasonable resource to many sudjects. My opinion on the matter is that computers are a benefitial asset to urban living. The reasons for this are simple. They teach hand-eye coordination, gives access to learn about exotic faraway lands, are another recource to online comunication. One of my reasons is clearly, online comunication. Since most computers have an ulimited power supply. More power equils more time to chat. If you computer has a webcam, webchats are also an option. Have this give a visual of your chat buddy. E-mail messaging is a quick way to talk with friends. My second reason is one of intelligents. A computer isn't just a toy or entertainment, it's also quick learning experience. The internet is a door to many interesting, exotic, unreachable areas. An example would be if you had a project, the computer would have endless amounts of information. If your looking to book a hotal, visit the hotels website. My final reason is one of my most highly, recognized. Hand-eye coordination is a skill most commonly used. Archers need hand-eye coordination to nail targets the first time. It seems important to most jobs or activities. Basketball players use it to pass, dribble, and shoot. Hand-eye coordination is an assential, key point in the lives of millions. So hand-eye coordination, communication, and learning are only few of the many reasons computers are a benefit to the homes of our people. The time is now. Make the decision. Ask youselves ""@CAPS1 will this effect the future?""",8
326,"Dear Local Newspaper, I Have heard that you are concerned that people use the computers too much when they could do other things. I disagree, because there are many things on the computer that could help you. First, find directions to a destination. Also, you are able to look up things that you need for a school project of life. Finally, you can interact with friends far away. as a result, I disagree that people should stop using computers and do other things. When you are lost and need directions, the computer can help. First, if you need to go somewhere and your lost go onto the computer. For example, if you are having trouble with reaching your destination, then go onto google maps and print out some directions to help you. Also, if you are going over to a friends house and don't know where it is, you would look it up on the computer. For instance, instead of using a map the computer prints step-by-step directions to your destination. Finally, if you are starting to drive and don't know your way around, go onto the computer. For example, on the computer, it has every destination in the @LOCATION1 which will help you get used to the city and roads. As you can see, using the computer is a faster/easier way to get directions and find your destinations. When reasearching, not everything is in books. First, you could look up videos, news, images, etc... For example, if you want to check a show or research things, the computer gives you a lot of results. Also, if comes in handy for school work. For example, you are able to type papers and research for projects. Finally, you can register for jobs and buy things on the internet. For example, for researching, you are able to buy tickets to a concert or and jobs. As you can see, using a computer can help you with research, buy things, and more. Interation with friends would be good, to stay in touch when they are far away. First, computer has facebook where you can talk to friends. For example, you can talk when your friend is even in another country far awa. Also, a computer has email too. For example, during work for parents, the can talk with other worker and get information without talking. Finally, it doesn't cost as much as talking on the phone. For instance, talking on the phone could be up to @MONEY1, when on the internet is doesn't cost anything. As a result, people are able to use the computer to stay-in-touch with friends far away. As you can see, there are many reasons why people should be able to use the computer. First, you are able to get directions. Also, research and look up thing for a job or school. Finally, to stay in touch with friends. People should be able to use computers more often.",10
327,If think that people computers do not spend all there time on them. Some people work on there computers so those people spend all day on computers but they do go home and interact with there familys. What would we do with out computers? I know your thinking that we don't need computers but they do come in handy sometimes. There fore I think that most people do not spend all there time on comuters. Second I think that computers help a lot with bills finances and paper work. If you owen a bussinass and you don't have an computer theres going to be @NUM1 time's the paper work. My mom and step father owns and run's a truking compine and about @PERCENT1 of the paper work is on an computer. My step father get most his loads coming home on the computer that would be hard to do without it. I know your thinking that what if the computer crashed? That would be a problem then. I think that if you have a bussinas you should have an computer. Third people use computers in personl resons to talk to relitives in other states. I my self email my mom all the time becouse she lives in @LOCATION1 I only see her for @NUM1 month out of the year and the computer is one way we can see each other. I think that computers are good for people.,7
328,"Dear Newspaper People, Computers are one if not the greatest invention ever. Computers help people with that work and schoolwork, allow you to talk to family members or friends, and you can even play computer games on a rainy day or if your not feeling to good. Computers are very helpful and very convienint for all ages. School students use computers for all kinds of things like typing up an essay or doing reasearch on the human body. Parents also use computers for work, parents usually if there a banker or a lawier always have a laptop on hand. Computers are also a very easy way to communicate with each other. Adults are always emailing each other about work or about breaking news. Teens and young adults are also constintly. Instant messaging each other about the latest gossip on facebook. Even younger children communicate to each other on club @LOCATION1, where they can chat with friends and play games with them. Computers are one of the best ways to communicate. Also computers can be used to play games like solitaire. On a rainyday when theres not much to do theres nothing better than a good old computer games. You can play with a friend or you can play alone, its just a great way to some time. When it gets boring you can just save that game and go and find a more fun different one. As you can see computers are incredible and could be the greatest creation of all. Because of all fantastic stuff. You can do like studying and working, communication with all of your friends and family, and for being able to play computer games or a rainy day. As you can see computers are incredible.",9
329,"Dear newspaper, Computers benefit the high-tech society that we now live in. They provide hand-eye coordination, the ability to learn about foreign places and people, also talking with other people. Hand-eye coordination is a very useful skill to have. Having a computer can help develop hand-eye coordination. They allow people to look at the screen while typing. This is easier than having to look at the keyboard, then back at the screen. Also having your hand-eye coordination developed by using your computer at home can help with phyisical exercise. People will be better at the sport, for example basketball and they want to go outsidb and play the sport, making them healthy. Computers also help you learn by having the ability to learn about faraway people and places. This can help you with a school project. They libary @MONTH1 be closed, and you need information about a place solve this, you could just go online and look it up. This way you can learn new things much faster than just a book library. A couple weeks ago, there was a big @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 project on the @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 expedition. It was easy because all I had to do was go onto one website. The website had all the information I needed for the whole project. Lastly, computers have social-networking sites. Here you can chat with friends online! some sites, you don't even need. In pay, but you would to talk on the phone. Last night, I had forgotten to write down my was for algebra. I just logged onto my account and asked someone. They answered and it saved me from getting a. Computers are good for the society. Now that you have read this letter, I think you agree.",8
330,"Computers are an addiction! The only activity this society needs more of is exercise. Our @CAPS1 should be enjoying nature and living closely with family and friends. Therefore, smash that off switch and go live healthy in the wilderness, with your relatives. A common issue the government has is addressing the community with health care reforms. The local scientist of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 has been researching a problem over the past twenty years. They have just made it fact that our has gained an additional @NUM1 million people to the obesity list since the @DATE1's. This shows on graphs and data an extra @PERCENT1. A huge cause for this weight gain of citizens is technology. The main reason is in almost every modernized home, the computer. A survey took last week says that many people are on the computer for more than @NUM1 hours each day. We can solve this situation by turning off those brain washing machines. There are many potential diseases if using a computer. As a result, almost @PERCENT2 of strokes and seisures are happening from this terrifying device. You might as well open the door and let them walk right in because by this way of hobbies you are treating your body with no respect. If only people would stop this madness and shutdown these computers to aid in the event of cutting down on the amount of patients that are in the hospitals every day. The wonderful open road! Explore what ever comes in mind because with a soul you have no limit. Don't waste away a perfect and excellent life on videogames and the internet. Burst threw those walls like a bulldozer sinking its teeth into the beautiful light and onto the other side, let there be no more darkness and explore what god gave you. There is absolutley no explanation for sitting in that awful room with only the glow of the computer screen leading your life into nothing. No excuses that I need information for my job or school. All you need is your five senses and nature to give every piece of and you @MONTH1 require. So shut that system dowm and lead your way outside where you will wander the true way of living. Spending time with your friends and family is based on everything. Do you think a life of meeting people and having a blast compares to that rusting chair in the corner of the house playing a game that would get you anywhere in life. I know it doesn't take five hours to check your inbox. Do you know how much families",8
331,"Dear @CAPS1, I agree with you and how people spend to much time on their computers. I think that people waste their lives on the computer. I know that it is good to look up info on the computer sometimes but people can do that and quickly get off instead of staying on. Most people play games and watch videos on the computer for hours, sometimes people can be on the computers for days when they are addicted to it. I think people forget the importance of working out or spending time with their family. One day one of your family members can be gone and you can regret not spending time with them. Also you could gain weight and not lose any calories from sitting at the computer for hours or days. Sometimes its good for you to get some fresh air instead of staying locked up in your house for hours or days. Working out or excersing is also good to do to. You can lose weight or gain muscle. Even taking a break from your computer and going on a quick walk is also good for you. Interacting with friend of enjoying nature help you also learn things instead of looking up nature on the computer. You could see animals, birds, and newplants from looking at nature. Maybe you can get a guide to show the plants and animals. You could walk through the woods or a forest. That way you exercise your legs and enjoy help your environment by picking up garbage or cans that people left in the woods or forest. You could walk lift up things an dhelp the environment, and animals. That way you gain leg strenght, and help out nature, and animals in it. Interacting with family and friends is also a good thing to do. Instead of talking to people on the computer on some internet you dont even know who these people can be. They can end up being really bad person or somebody who could bully you online. but if you interact with family and friend syou know that they are good people, you know that they arent bad people or that they wont bully you. Also interacting with your family and friends can help help with your social skills and that can help you in the future. In conclusion interacting with family and friends, working out is better then staying on the computer. You can lose weight and gain muscle. You can save nature and help your environment, or from interacting you can get better social skills and spend time with your family and friends.",9
332,"Dear Local @CAPS1, @CAPS2 has come to my attention that computers have a big effect on people. Computers prevent people from going outside, they becme lazy, and spend less time with their family and friends. No worries thought, I am here to explain the reasons more to you so have a better understanding on computers effecting people. First computers prevent people from going outside. I would think that people might actually want to get fresh air, but i guess not. By them having fresh air @CAPS2 makes their brains think better. also computers make them not able to play with friends. Instead they play games and activities online. All people should see their freinds in person, not just talk to them on the internet. Second, computers make people lazy. When they become lazy they dont excercise or which causes their body to become unhealthy. In fact, our country doesnt really need or can afford for people being unhealthy becasue we are known as the most obeast state. As I said about people, being lazy causes people not to eat right, well @CAPS2's true. People who are on their computers mostly just eat junk food. For example, they might be on a game or talking to a friend, and they want something to eat so they run to the kitchen and get a bag of chips because @CAPS2's quick and easy to get. When instead they could get something real to eat. Most importantly, computers make people spend less time with family and friends. They are on computers all day that @CAPS2 comes down to some not even talking or seeing their mothers, fathers, and even siblings. Now honestyly thats pretty sad to hear. People arent going to be able to bond with friends and family when their upstairs or wherever the computer is. All their be able to do is bond with them online which really isn't the same as in real life. So @CAPS3 again computers have big effects on people because they prevent people from going outside, make people lazy, and makes them spend less time with family and friends. Hopefully I explained the reasons well enough so that they will say something about @CAPS2 in the newspaper. Thanks for listening.",9
333,"Dear @CAPS1: I have recently heard that you want to know what kind of effects to people think computers have on them. In the past a survey like this was never taken. I believe a survey needs to be taken. In my opnion, computers have agreat effect on people. First, they teach hand-eye coordination. Now days you need good hand-eye coordiantion for a lot of jobs. You also need it to drive a car. What teaches better hand-eye coordination than a computer? In my past expierences, I have found that computers, for me, are the best things to teach hand-eye coordination. Where would people be today without hand-eye coordiantion or even computers? In a recent survey taken in my town over @PERCENT1 of the people in the town say they don't know where they would be right now if they never got good hand-eye coordiantion from using computers. Even @PERSON1, a human function reaches says that if you want to have a good job then you need hand-eye coordiantion. Second, they give people the ability to learn about far away places without to travel far. This is extremly helpful because if someone is doing a report they don'tt need to travel to @LOCATION1 to learn more about the tiger. Instead they just stay home and use the computer do get all the information they need. Not only is it convient but it also saves you thousands of dollars. It you so much because you don't need to go far to find information about far away places. In fact, according to a survey taken over <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of people in ym town sya sthe computer saves them the money and of travelling far away. If you do want to travel, it can help money. @PERSON2, animal reacher says she always is using the computer to time and money. Last, you can talk to people from around the world online. Talking to people online can seen you thousands or more depending on what your job is. If you're a big @CAPS2.E.O. of a company and need to travel around a lot to meet people, you can save lots of money by using a internet chat room. Or if you're a mom and you have to stay home with sick kids you can still be at work online. Using online chat rooms you can still ""go to work"" and take care of the kids. It can even help if you got a flat tire on the way to a meeting. Just go to a internet-cafe and oyu can still use the intenet to be at the meeting. In fact, I use the internet to talk with my friends so the phone bill doesn't go through the roof. In conclusion, I believe computers have a greta effect on people. y reasons are: They teach you good hand-eye coordiantion, you can learn about faraway places without traveling and you can talk to people online. I you to see computers as a good effect. The future of computers is in your hands.",10
334,"Dear Newspaper, I believe that computers have a positive affect on people. I belive this because computers are a way of communicating, traveling and people use them if they have a disability. First, computers are a way of communicating. You can get in touch with people near or far. Most of my family lives in @LOCATION1 and no communicate with them I go on video chats. It's just a good way to keep in touch with close ones, and be up to date with them. Second, people use computers for traveling. You can research on places to go, sites to see and transportation such has planes and cars. You can book hotels too. lastly people through a computer or if they are deaf they can. only type this helps doctors their work with disabled people to communicate with them In conclusion, I believe computers have a positive on people because they are used for communicate traveling and for people with disabilities ",6
335,"Computors are a is to our society. They are absolutly unimportant, and quiet irrelbuent to the common persons use. Yes, I admit computors are easy for everyday work and is something to keep busy, but all this is preventing young children and adults to do what they have to do to be fit, have a social life and there are plenty more efficient ways to entertain ones self. Exercise is important! It keeps our bodies in shape and keeps us healthy. Computors is a new way of entertainment. This new source of entertainment is making children and adults lazy. Books when the common person didnt have computors they would go out and do something with or make fun outdoor plans. And the younger kids would go outside and play fun active games or play mental enhancing bord games. Due to the common use of computors people aren't getting exercise they need, and thats a problem. People of all ages need friends and a social life to keep happy or to have any encouragement or fun to be to do good things. All people need some sort of social engagement everyonce in a while. Even kids from @NUM1 need to have fun with friends and go out. Computors is stopping kids from and making actuall friends. Computors are a menis to kids who need companionship. Besides computer life there are a ton of ways to entertain ones self. No one deserves to sit and do nothing all day on a computer. It does not teach hand eye coordination. It only dumbs those real down to just clicking a mouse. And what if the electricity stops working? What if all we on was electronics? There would be nothing and people would go into a panic computors are just a and miss oportunity to children. In conclution, computors the healthy growth us physicall activity, computors keep kids and adults from actually doing somthing productive, and finnally, computers. Is not the only way of entertainment. We all need to step away from the computer monitor and yet a life worth liveing and remembring. Stop the dangerous cycle!",8
336,"Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 first of all computers are great tecnoligy for the @CAPS2 industry because they give you something to do if your bored. Computers can let any person do what ever they want weather its talking to freinds typing a story or even playing games for fun. But its not a good idea to be on it all day long, every one still needs to go outside and play or go to the park with freinds. Now most of the time people sit on the computer all day and try to droid freinds. Computers are also like a mall online on sites like e-@CAPS3 or @CAPS4 @CAPS5. There is so much stuff on e-@CAPS3, but don't forget going to the town mall is fun to because you can go with friends. One thing a computer can do is if your waiting for something go on the computer most of the time you loose track of time another thing is there are some people that stay on them for hours and hours and not do much with there lifes and there are the people that use it in a good way by doing something for work or buying a stock or some money makeing reason. Computers also have places to find things if your stuck about something like google wikipedia or even dictionary.com to get info on things you don't know. If computers werent invended life would go alot slower. Do I use computers alot yes. Do other people yes and yes I think computers are good because if you band them that would make alot of people very unhappy.",7
337,"Dear local news @CAPS1, I think that computers benifit people by hand I coordination, talk to people from a round the @CAPS4, and also learn things like @LOCATION1 having almost the biggest eartquake. Just thing you want to learn. One way people can benifit from the computer is hand - eye coordination so if some one tryes to punch you real fast you can black it. The gym dosent teach you hand - eye coordination. So the computer is the only way to get cat like reflexs. (Hand-eye coordination). And what better way to learn it than on the computer. Another way that the computer benifits you is that you can talk to people. It is actually a great feature. You can talk to people from all over the @CAPS4. So if you knew a person from school and then that person moved some where far away you can still be really close to that freind. You can be in a chat room with as many freind as you want so you can talk and it wont put any money on the cell phone bill or home phone. One of the greatest benifits from the computer is you can learn stuff that you've never heard of. Alot of people didn't know about the @LOCATION1 earthquake untill they went online and found out. Because if they didn't know how would they know what there are far charaties for @CAPS2. So what if they wanted to know how to adobt a @LOCATION1 kid. Well for starters they could go online to find out. And we can go online to find a great gym to @CAPS3 at. Wheather it is ""@CAPS3 out @CAPS4"" or planer fitness you can see all the recomendations so you dont mak a mistake at picking the wrong gym. And those are my reason why I think the computer is good to have around.",8

Such as, having citizens all around the world that have stopped exercising. They've also stopped enjoying the little things like nature and listening to the wonderful chirping birds that wake them up in the morning with their melodies. @CAPS7 all we @CAPS2, having computers around could keep the user from interacting with their friends or family. First of all, I want to @CAPS2 what happened to all of the kids who used to be hanging outside with their friends, or walking to the store to get some eggs and cheese @CAPS7 their mom. Oh, that's right! Now I @CAPS2 what happened! They got a computer @CAPS7 their birthday! Not to mention that the percentage @CAPS7 kids being outside with their friends dropped down from @PERCENT1 to @PERCENT2! Aha! Now, the percentage @CAPS7 kids staying inside on the computer went from @PERCENT3 to @PERCENT4! Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Because I'm thinking that that's why we're seeing the @CAPS4 population going up in the world. Secondly, how many families do you see going on hikes and enjoying the nice weather? If I'm lucky I'll probaly see one of @CAPS1 neighbors go camping during the @DATE1 ! Worst of all, @CAPS1 family doesn't even go out @CAPS7 hikes or camping trips ! Every year @CAPS1 parents keep saying that we'll go camping, but when the time comes to go, they postpone to the next year, and the next, and the next. Since that's been going on @CAPS7 three years, I'm not even going to ask if we're camping this year. The worst thing though, is never going out with families anymore. @CAPS7 instance, every-stinking - day when @CAPS1 mom comes home from work guess whre she's going? The computer! But, ever guess what she's going on? Facebook, to update her dumb page! Even better, that's what @PERCENT1 of @CAPS5 do in the @LOCATION1 @CAPS6, that's exactly why I fancy myself with reading, and during the @DATE1 I go outside, take a blanket by down, and read or take a nap. You should even try it one day, and get your glued butt off that nice, soft computer chair. @CAPS6, here's the question. Are you a computer person, or are you not? Because if you are you probaly won't read it, and you'll go back to the computer. However, if you aren't one of those people, maybe just maybe you'll read this and tell your friends and family to get off the computer and take a hike. @CAPS6, please do and while you're at it, lock the door and keep them outside @CAPS7 the day and let them soak in nature.

The computer is probly one of the best inventions since cars. The computer is a great tool that should be taken advange of.",9
340,"Dear NewsPaper, I am writing this letter to you because the effects computers have on people are lots of people like to go on computers to talk to friends, play games online with other people, and to do online research for school, work, or other companys these are my opinions. My first reason is to talk to friends people talk to friends online because if they don't see them anymore thats their way to communicate with them because they moved away or if they want to do something over the @DATE1 and they need to get a hold of them because they might not have a phone or they just want to have a nice long conversation with a friend because some people like to tell their closs friends about whats happening in their lives if they are getting bullied is having trouble at home the always have someone to to talk with so thats why we have computers to talk to friends. My second reason is to play games with others a lot of people like to play games with people they don't know at all or sometimes people that they don't know because they want to meet new people or try something new and people play games games just for fun and im not talking about games on the internet. Im talking about accual games like for example world of warcraft, counter strike source is a first person game this is another reason why people to play games online. My last reason is to do research for school or work sometimes you go for school and you need to do research on lets say @ORGANIZATION1 or you need to turn in an assignment for your job or your fired this is all I could think for now. I can't think of anything for this reason. I hope you could come to an agreement that computers are really usefull to talk to friends, play games, and do research for school or work.",8
341,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 of all the things you can learn on a computer, billions of webpages, filled with information. Computers are very useful, and helpful in our day in age; people use them for fun, school, work, and interest. People rely on computers mostly for safety, connecting with other people, and educaiton/work. Humans coudn't be as intelligent without computers. Computers have a very big effect on people. Of, all the things computers can @CAPS2, protecting our safety is one of the most important. Computers can @CAPS2 many things with weather. Ther can help measure air-pressure, wind speed,and predict tornadoes, hurricanes and many more. And, not only @CAPS2 computers help predict the weather, they help show computer viewers the weather. Any viewer who has a computer, can go on to a weather website, to check what the weather forecast is in their area. Well @CAPS2 you know when you meet someone new? You're a little suspicious? and you want to see if they once where or are a criminal. Computers keep history of criminals, so you can simply type in their name, and a backround check of the person will come up. Lee @CAPS3 says, ""I met this new man in town, he looked nice, but I had to be sure, I backround checked him, and found out he was in jail for burglary, I made sure never to reveal where I lived to him."" Not only @CAPS2 computers help secure your safety, they can help you connect with people all over the world. Billions of people are one computers every day. So, everytime you are on a computer you could meet up with someone who studies something you're interested in.Next many children and adults have family whom they live far away from, They can use the computer to find the relatives number or meet up with them on twitter or facebook. Kids can also find friends whom they had lost touch with. Computers obviously aren't a bad influence on the human race. Did you know students (@PERCENT1) use computers to help with homework? Many useful websites are there for students to help them through a tough homework assignment. Say, if @PERSON1 was having trouble with the word ""el sacapuntas"" in @CAPS4 class. She could go to a @CAPS4 to @CAPS6 dictionary online, and find out it means pencil sharpener. Studies show, kids who use computers to help with their homework get better grades then kids who didn't in a result of @NUM1. Many teachers also use computers to help them teach. They can find extra information about the section they are studying, or find games for their students to play: that connects to their subject of course. Mrs. K says, I am a seventh grade science teacher, I could not live without my computer. I use it for grades and for getting in touch with student's parents and much more."" Computers are necessary for learning. In conclusion, computers are heavily relied on in today's day in age. They keep humans safe, they help people connect with others and help learning. People aren't over using computers, because we need them to survive.",10
342,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am @NUM1-year old student in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1. Me being a teenager and all you'd probably assume that I love all of the new technology coming out recently. I am however, against it. Once someone gets on the computer, they wont' be offer hours. They are truly missing out on life. Computers users should have limits so that we as a country can improve our health standards, reconnect with friends and family, and protect ourselves from the vicious world of the computer. First of all, our health standards have fallen quite a bit. The obesity rate has gone up by @PERCENT1 in the past @NUM2 years. Admit it, our country grows lazier and lazier by the minute when we have new technology to do simple tasks for us. Such as cracking eggs for us! It is unnecessary! I've also noticed that not many kids go outside and play anymore. What happend to going to your neighbor's house and asking them to play kickball? Our lives have been sucked into a black hole that is controlled by a cyber filled world. Gym class @MONTH1 be the only time that some students ever indulge in physical activities. It is time to make our country healthy again just one step at a time. Our second step could relate to reconnecting with family and friends. Secondly, our lives are no longer personal. We share everything with everyone. Take my mom for example. If she wanted to reconnect with high school friends, she could easily go on facebook and type them a message. Sure that's easy but wouldn't it be so much greater if my mom wrote a letter. It adds a more personal touch to whatever my mom wants to say. I'm also positive that the receiver would much rather get a letter than a facebook message. The internet lets you reconect, but the experience of meeting up with the person @MONTH1 lead you to much greater rewards. Not to mention that the internet can be very dangerous. The world of computers can be very dangerous to the unexperienced eye. First of all, there are many cases of cyber bullying. Not only has cyber bullying hurt people's feelings some kids have taken their life because of it. It happens everywhere and it needs to be stopped. Secondly, people put up provocative pictures themselves, which can lead to stalkers or ridicule. Girls and boys can get kidnapped by other people because of this. In some cases, because of the pictures, two people will meet one will ask if they can meet somewhere and then they can get taken, @CAPS3, there are many many hackers. If you input a credit card number on a site, someone could use it to put even more many on the cord. Finally, viruses come around all the time, In order to clean them off or if you have to buy a new computer, it costs a decent amount of money, which you would not want to waste. In conclusion, I believe that people need to limit themselves with how long they spend on the computer, and what they do an it as well. I'm not saying that computers should be banned; people just need to be aware of what they do. Instead of spending three hours on facebook, why not spend half-an-hour on facebook and then go outside, play with their friends, and embrace the sweet scents of nature. Computers can be useful, when used the right way. Until then, we should try to put out a good message of staying fit, getting outside and learning how to do things for ourselves.",11
343,"How often do you use a computer? How does computers affect your life? Without a doubt I would say that computers benefit society more than you can imagine for a few reasons. Computers help us connect to the world, learn about many different places, events and cultures and help to spread the word about events or buisness etc. To start computers help us connect to the world. This means that computers allow people to talk online with other people through websites like facebook, twitter, @CAPS1. etc. Even with people around the world, or to your neighbor across the street. This helps people and encourages kids to socialize with other people. Through many people can find or reconnect with people from their. In addition, computers also hold tons of information for children and adults like to find and learn about. The amount of knowledge you can obtain through computers is endless. Even teachers use the internet and computers to reaseach topics that will teach in school. The students also use computers to research topics they learn about in school. When a teacher tells a class to research something approximitly @PERCENT1 use computers and the internet alone. You can learn so much through computers. Furthermore computers can be used to ""spread the word"" about events, business and products. Many buisness use websites to advertise and sell their products. This helps to jumpstart and business which is important in our current schools can also have a website, to tell when scholl events are and what the homework is it you are absent. It is very helpful to the student, and teachers. On the whole I believe that computers benefit society for the reasons stated above.",8
344,"Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, This letter is in regard to your article on how computers @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not help society. I am I firm believer that computers greatly benefit society. Computers allow us to learn about places far away, assist us in learning about nature, and allow us to communicate with people all over the world. Almost every country in the world has access to the @CAPS2. Their governments also have sites which we can learn about. Did you know that in a great study, a set of students were told to find the history of three random countries using the @CAPS2, every student was able to write entire essays using the information recieves. In fact, <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of all students have access to the @CAPS2. Your article stated that computers do not help us in understanding natures using supercomputers, we have technology capable of performing calculations that would take humans much too long to complete. This way, we can learn about physics, quantum mechanics, electricity and more. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of all synthetic elements were discovered using computers? In fact, without a computers ability nto perform advanced calculations in a matter of milliseconds, we would never know how these elements would react in the outside world. Now do you agree with me on the benefits of computing? The @CAPS2 is a great way to communicate with people online. It can talk to practically anyone in the world who has access to the @CAPS2. In fact, <@PERCENT1@NUM2> of users chat with other people online. In a @DATE1 study, @NUM3 adults were told to talk to someone from every country. <@PERCENT1@NUM4> of them were able to complete this task. By now you must realize that computers are a benefit to society and is a tool in discovering secrets of nature allows us to communicate with people and learn.",9
345,"Dear @CAPS1, Have you ever thought @DATE1 how many children or young women get raped or hurt physically for chating with strangers online? or have you ever thought @DATE1 how many young children @DATE1 adults commit crime by meeting up with someone they don't know on enternet? Have you ever even wondered why your child scores so low on states test or does poorly in their academic class? Many children and adults spend to much time on the computer rather than getting their education and enjoying the short wonderful life we have. I believe that people should spend less time on computers. @CAPS2 will decrease the chances @DATE1 others getting raped or hurt physically, @CAPS2 will increase your childs grades in their academic classes and test scores, and lastly, people will be spending much more time with their family and friends. During @DATE1 a youg man named @PERSON1 was walking home from school in @LOCATION1. As he was walking home a fight had broken at @PERSON1 try to exit the large fight then suddenly a group @DATE1 young men who took part in the fight begin to attack him with a wooden stick. They each litterally beat with the stick, punched him with their fist, and stamped him with their foot. Each @DATE1 the boys begin to run as @CAPS3 friends came after him. @CAPS3 friends begin to pull @PERSON1 into the school building. As they entered @PERSON1 into the building, he sad was gone forever. @PERSON1 was only @NUM1 years old and was an honor student. A few weeks after @CAPS3 brutal death someone who was a bystander at the fight had video recorded the beating @DATE1 @PERSON1. They had past @CAPS2 up on youtube for the world to see. A few years ago a @NUM2 @DATE1 old girl and a @NUM3 @DATE1 old man met on myspace.com. The young girl had lied and claimed to the young man that she was @NUM4 years @DATE1 age and divorce. She and the young man had sex. The young man was sent to court and claims he didn't know she was @NUM2. Now the young man is frighten and nervous that he will be in a jailbait. During the mont @DATE1 @DATE2, a young african american girl named @PERSON2 went to harlem right after speaking to her best friend. She was sent into a building with a group @DATE1 guys her friend had known. These young men tryed to rape her but suddenly she had suffered from an ashma attack and heart attack from being frighten. @PERSON2 was my older cousin by @NUM6 years, her body was left in the building until late @DATE3 @DATE1 @NUM7. Dead at the age @DATE1 @NUM1, her young soul will rest on. Many children in the @LOCATION2. A scare very law on their states test. Many parents wonder are they get enough sleep? Are they studing enough? or should e support them more? Whats making children not want to study is the computer. Many children spend all day and all night on different websites instead @DATE1 doing algebra questions for only @NUM9 mins. The computer keeps people from doing what they are supposed to be doing. Some people are so addicted to the computer they don't even spend time with their families. If people don't spend so much time on computer they be more focus in.",10
346,"I think people use the computer for many reasons. Frist of all because you get to meet People online and you get to chat whit them. My second reason is that you could find infromation faster. My last reason is that you can do a lot of things. I think many People use the computers. specially because they get to meet people. But mostly young People use the computers because they get to chat whit there freinds. you get to @CAPS3 them better. Theres a'lot of websites that people use to find freind. For example @CAPS1, yahoo, facebok and many more. So theres a lot of people send you freind @CAPS2 and they get to @CAPS3 you and you get to @CAPS3 them. My second reason. Is one of the most and reason I's because they use the about . So you go to use the internet to find that imformation. So thas one of the ways that People use the computers. My last reason of why computers are so important. Is because you dont only use the computers to meet new People. Or find imformation about what ever you looking for. But you could also do many thing. for example play games, @CAPS4 stoff online. But you could also look for anything you want to look even if you want to find a resepy. You see whit computer you can do many things. So those are my reasons why I think computers are so important. You get to meet new People make lot of freinds. You get to find a lot of imformation on the assigment they give you. And last because in the computer you could do many things you want to do.",8
347,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think its bad for people to keep going on the computers because people wont get enough exercise, hang out with friends and family. It will also break the bond between you and you'r family, and friendships with friends, it will only happen if you'r glued to the seat and stare at the screen all day. It can be good to, for little kids, well not even little kids, adults to sometimes need help with keyboarding for at least one hour ady, so they all can pay with friends and chill with the family for a little. Whenever the kids and adults have time to practise, they, you don't have to do every single day, or not right when you get get home from work or school. It is also bad cause your missing out on a lot of things, for example.......... Sports, softball/baseball, soccer, basketball, you will miss all of that. Now about when a friend calls and asks you if you want to come over, because she's having a sleep over with a lot of other friends, and it's going to be school much fun! But your going to be sooooo much fun! But your going to say no because the computer is sure much better. Everyone is going to start ignoring you, no ones going to sit next to you at lunch. Soon your parents are going to benn you from the computer and say ""you can go on the computer no more, you can only go on it for @NUM1 mins, to only check your e-mail,...... you are going to spend time with the family and your friends, and going back to playing sports. The story is about, if kids and adults need help with key boarding then they can at teast go on for only an hour, if they have time. Finally, staying on the computer @NUM2 everyday can affect your friendship and your bond with your family.",8
348,"Dear Local Newspaper, I think computers are a good thing to have in a household, so I agree with the people who support this decision. I think they are great to have in households or anyhwere, where the public can use them because they can help us in many ways. The ways computers help us are if we need to contact other people, you can do all your finances and things on computors and you can also play many educational games. Contacting other people on a computor is very easy and helpful. You could contact other people from e-mail, calling, text messaging, video chats, etc. But e-mail is probably the most common way. You would think texting or calling was but scientists took a survey and every @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people use e-mail for contacting people more often. Also on the computor you can do video chats video chatting is another way of talking to someone but also being able to see his or her face at the same time. Another reason as to why people refere to computers for contacting other people is because not everyone has a cell phone. So the only way they can reach them is by e-emailing. Now the list of contacting people could go on for days since theres so many ways you can do that but i'm going to move and the ability they have for educational purposes. Computers have so many different websites for educational purposes. They have worksheets, quizes, games, etc. Also they have all thoughs types of examples for different kinds of languages. you could learn how to write and/or read in different languages on computers. Sometimes my school teachers will asign us websites to do for homework(educational websites). Scientists figured out more students learn better or understand better by playing / doing online work for homework instead of doing worksheets all the time. So computers also make it easy for teachers when teaching a lesson in class and they have games and websites for it. If we miss days of school the teacher could also just assign homework for us to do so use could just check her webpage for that stuff, if we don't have computers then their'd be no way the teachers could do that. My family, maybe even your families too, we normally book vacations from the internet. We look for the place we would like to travel to then we find a hotel and book it straight from the web. The website already has pictures and everything you won't even need a telephone! Statistics show that every @NUM3 out of @NUM1 families/people use the internet to book vacations and things. If you book a hotel and need to get on a plane to get there you also have the ability to do that from the computers, too. Computers can be a very fast and efficant way to get things done which could be very useful and helpful. Computers also help reduce driving, it can save you money on gas. Computers can help you in ways you wouldn't imagine.",10
349,"Dear Local Newspaper, I am weiting to you to tell you. My opinion on the effects computers have on people. First I would like to start off ny saying computers are a good resourse. Some adults use the computer to do taxes and advance check books. Another way the computer is used as a resource as teenagers who are seniors in and out of high school have to apply for colleges online. Others apply for campus jobs as well to help pay twoition. Secondly some people say if you stay on the computer long you'll lose contact with family and friends. Well what if you have a relative in lets say florida and you live in @LOCATION1 you'll want to stay in touch. Plus you wont be able to drive down there with gas prices what the are. Flying is an option, but its also expensive. Other times people mail letters but wait a long time for one back. Lastly people who have jobs want promotion. But cant take it simply because they need a high school diploma or they didnt the third grade. Well they could look online to find the best highschool in the state for a shot at that promotion. Alsp if people need a job they could find a nice paying one in another or in area. Thank you for your time.",7
350,"Do you think that computers are a benifactor? Some people say they teach hand-eye coordiation, and talk online with other people. I dont think so, I think computers are a waste of time. You can hang out with friends, stay in the house all day and missing good times. Now reasearch shows that @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 uses the comupter. Now who has a facebook, myspace, or any social network? We all do. Now how many hours are you on it, two or mabey four? I think I made one point lets go on how computers are bad. When's the last time you went with your friends? A day, three days? Get off the computer you're friends are probly mad at you. It's time to log off facebook, myspace..ect and you need to go outside with your friends to play tag football, manhunt... ect. If you stay on that computer to long and avoid you're friend it's bad and you don't want to learn the hard way because you wont have friends. How about your faimly. The last time you're faimly was down you will ask you're self ""I'll go when I'm done with this level. ""You wont trust me you will get sucked into the game like a vacume cleaner clean your floor. That are that cant come out of the carpet thats you because the vacume cleaner is still sucking you in untill its all gone. Stop getting caught up in you're games online or facebook stop relax and hang out with you're friends treat them to diner and samthing. You jus have to get off the computer and go before someone is gone. Next step is you're missing. Did you miss a party latley because you were online playing a addictive game what about that high school reunion? You miss a lot of things when you are in a trance by the computer. Outside you see your friends playing football and you say ""I'll join them after I finish the game"" by the time you finished it is eight o'clock and everyone is in bed sleeping. You probably missed a fun game and you didn't get any exercise. Have you thought about it? Is the computer good or is it just getting in our way. Next time you're friends, faimly come knock on the door for you even if it's just to play football or hang out shut the laptop hop of the chair and be with friends and faimly always keep that in the back of youre head. I hope you got a good idea of what is happing to kids and mabey you so lets never log back on the computer again.",8
351,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 my gosh that was so funny, and did you see what she was wearing. That was an example at how meaningless time is being wasted away on the computers as far as doing silly thing such as social networking, instint messaging, emailing and such more! Now dont get me rong if you do this for a liveing to support a family by working with computers. I agree with that @PERCENT1. For other indeviduals this is a differant case; when these indeiduals get no important over all benifit. I think every one can benifit by spending more on your time exersising one setting active. Also becuse when you spend less time on the computer then I think the counts of syber bullying would decrease dramaticaly. Finaly I think that over all it would increase family's to come together and spend quality time. First I think that spending less time on computers would be a good thing becuse we have to face the fact over a half of the @ORGANIZATION1 is obease. So instead of being on the computer its very smart to go outside and get some exercise, play some sports, and even if you have a dog take him/her for a nice walk. People dont realize doing such can benifit more than just you. Some of the people who support advances in technology. Say that the computer teaches hand eye coordination well you know what else going to the park and play catch with a base ball or foot ball (ex). Next I think that with less time being spent on the computer I expect there to be a dramatic change in bullying which can help also prevent the of sexual preditors becase this change would not just benifit children but every one to feel more safe. Finaly, And I think this argument is best of all. This will give familys a push to spend more time together. I know for a fact that the most important thing in a childs life is family even though one @MONTH1 not think so it is and if every family has a chance to do so than I think this will result in a better futer for every one. As you can see, over all I think by stoping time spent on computers. This will result. In family spending more time together. Less syber bullying. And going out and exersizing/getting fresh air. Thank you!",9
352,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I agree that computers sould be used because of the cool things that it could do like you can get on myspace, facebook, youtube, and other cool sites but let get to the deal people used computer because it help them learn better and see everyting and you get to talk to people all over the world but for me. I like to get on the computer to check myspace on other thing but i think that people love to get on the computer because it dont matter if they do they exercising or not cause with out computers people will have to do a hole lot of writing but with computers. You could do everything i feel like people love to use computers in this life time",6
353,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 name is @PERSON1. i am @NUM1 years old and a student at @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1 I am writing this letter because I think computers benefit society. In @CAPS2 opinion I think they have a positive affect. in this letter I will tell you all the reasons why, so keep reading and I hope you fell the same way when you finish. @CAPS2 first reason is that computers allow you to talk online with other people. For example, when I go on the computer I meet new people that I would never met without a computer. Last week on facebook I found @CAPS2 friend that ive lost contact with and havn't spoken to for years. I have recently read on the internet that about every @NUM2 relationship started out by meeting each other online. @CAPS2 second reason is that it gives you ability to learn about far away places and people. For example, when I am assigned to do a project about any country, place, or people I can use the internet for help. This would make me know more about something and understand it better. A couple months ago I had a social studies project due on the thirteen colonies, without a computer I wouldn't have a clue what to write about. Having the internet makes everything easier. @CAPS2 third reason is that they teach hand eye coordination. For example, when I use the computer I dont need to look down to type. This helped @CAPS2 brain memorize the key board. With this kind of skill you would have more job opportunities. @DATE1, I was watching the news and have heard that over @PERCENT1 of the jobs now a days involve computers. Someone might say that they are concerned about people spending too much time on computers and less time exercising. However, I dont agree with this at all smart and healthy,people find a way to do both. For example, alot of @CAPS2 friend spend most of their time online chatting or browsing the internet, but they find sometime to go out for a walk or play same sports. In conclusion, I think computers benefit the society because they are able to talk to others online, learn about places and people, and teach them hand-eye coordination. I hope you agree with me reading this and change your mind if you thought differently.",9
354,"Although computers can be very helpful, there are many negative effects that they can have on people. Chatting online can be dangerous, people spend too much time using them, and they cost money. There are many more reasons why computers can cause problems, but these are some of the main concerns. If you're not careful, chatting online can become very dangerous. Especially younger children that don't know better, using a website where you can chat to people can become an issue fast. Sometimes people pretend they are someone they aren't, and if you give out too much personal information, then something serious can happen. You can never know for sure who you're talking to, or what you might be getting yourself into. Many people spend too much of their time on the computer, which @MONTH1 cause many problems. If your on the computer in all of your spare time, then how can you get anything else done. Exercising is one problem. If you don't exercise enough, then you could gain weight fast which would bring additional issues. Also, being on the computer too much can cause problems for you in school. Since you're on the computer from the time you get home, until you have to go to bed when do you do homework? This can cause many problems. For example, your slip. If this happens then you might class. If you fail you might have to go to summer school, or even worse. Stay. When that happens you're parents will most likely get mad at you, and you your priviledges for the, even if you do. A computers cause many problems because of the cost. Computers cost a lot but then you have the paper and ink. Plus, if you have any teenagers in the house, they will probably want to have their in computer or a . If you get the to use it you @MONTH1 not even it. Some of my friends have a webcam and use it on a website they thought was free, but it actually costs extra money after a certain amount of days. With the way the economy is now, people don't have money to buy computers and all the accesseries that are wanted with them because it is not a necessity. And if you already have a computer then you know how much everything costs, and it can get very expensive very quickly. These are the many reasons why I think that computers have many negative effects. Chatting is very dangerous because you can never know who the person is really like. It can take up too much time and not allow you to do what is important like exercising or even doing homework, and finally, it costs way too much money and with the way the economy is. People losing jobs and not having any money, its no longer a neccessity. You could live without one, so why go through the trouble of getting one, and creating all those risks for yourself.",9
355,"Computers have advanced a lot over time. They've gone from being the size of a room to practically hand held. But are computers always a good thing? Computers can be very bad and addicting. Books are @CAPS1 as good as computers are to find information. Think about all the computers hackers taht could claw their way into your personal information on the computer. Have computers really made a big positive impact on our world at all? Your mom calls you down for dinner, but you say, ""@CAPS1 a minute! I'm on the computer!"". Computers can be very addictive. There are games and websites on a computer that can suck you in, and you wouldn't even realize it. Spending so much time on the computer takes away from doing other activities, like exercise. Did you know that more than fifty percent of frequent computer-users are overweight or obese? This is because they like their computer's so much, they don't find any time to exercise. Is this a good impact to our society? When you walk into a library lately, you see more people researching on the computer rather than at a table with an encyclopedia or a book. Books hold the same (and sometimes more) amount of information as the internet does. People choose the internet over books because they like the high-tech feelig of the internet, or now they can flip to a new page with the click of a mouse. Books are more practically and you can't copy and paste words right from the back onto your article, so there's a smaller chance of copyright. Books are the better choice over the internet. You have @CAPS1 recieved a call from your banker telling you that all you money has been taking from your account. As you listen in shock, your banker explains that since you use the internet to pay your bills, someone hacked into your account and made a withdrawl. All the money you've been saving for years and years is suddenly gone. All because the internet is an easier and faster way to pay your bill. But the technique of ""hacking"" into a computer grew @CAPS1 as fast as the computer itself did. Ten percent of people who put personal information (such as social security numbers, bank account passwords, etc.) into their computer end up having their money taken away by a hacker. That puts a bad effect on people's lives, society, and computers. Computers do not a big positive impact on society. People become easily addicted, causing many problems for themselves. Using a computer as a research - tool can sometimes be more complicated than @CAPS1 using a book. Paying bills or using a computer to file any personal information can eventually make many financial problems for people later on in life. Computers are not good for our society, or the world.",10
356,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 has come to my attention of more and more people use computers, and less time exercising, enjoying nature, with family and friends. I personally disagree about about this opinion. In addition, not only @CAPS1 will affect of how people are attracted to computers, but @CAPS1 will also affect of how people have to work on there computers. If this opinion was agreed for the people, this will hurt our lives of doing variety things on the computers. My first main reason of why many people use computers but less time doing other things which is because of how people have to work on there computers for there job. There are almost about @PERCENT1 people that I've seen before that there doing different variety things on the computer, in the library and I've seen my father always working on the computer to print & send out fliers & checks his messages (e-mail) on the internet. @CAPS1 always happens to people because there jobs are slow, losing there employers, or etc. The final main reason of why people are using computers but less time doing other things to, is because of how people are attracted to use the computers. For example, there many people especially children and teens like to use the computers is because they can play games on the internet, listen to music, watch videos, write documents, or play games on the @CAPS2-@CAPS3 discs. This has accured for a long time because people or kids don't know what is wrong and what is the right thing to do. If you choose to use the computers for your entire life, ask yourself one or two questions, what would happen if you choose not to use the to help with something? or what will you do in your life?",8
357,"@DATE1 @CAPS1 @PERSON1, I don't think that there is a single thing wrong with computers. They allow teenagers like me, to talk to family & friends out of state, without bringing up the phone bill. There's nothing you can't find on the computer now-a-days, and not to mention, all the cool stuff you can do with them. Just think about it, not being able to see or talk to you family and your friends. That would be terrible for me, mainly because I have a tight bond with both. Computers allowed me to see and talk to my aunt in @LOCATION1, for seven years with a webcam, how awesome is that?! It's the same exact thing with my friends too! When they leave the state I always talk to them via computer. Technology has and thats definatly @PERCENT1 for the best! Instead of bringing up the phone bill, & talking on the phone, just buy a webcam & instead of just talking to them, you'll be able to see them too! Just try it, look up anything & everything, I'd bet you'll find it. When I have to do projects, I can do them in a flash! All I need is google by my side! Since they made internet available on cell phones & iPods, I have that internet with me everywhere I go. I just find it amazing how much the world changed since my parents were kids! If I wanted to name all the cool stuff on the computers, then I wouldn't be able to fit it on the page, so I wont. But, you could buy your favorite things online, you can play games, and interact with people. Interacting with people is great, because you learn to make a new friend, while your in the process of doing just that! In conclusion, computers do benefit everybody. Theres so much more stuff they can do, I can't even name them all! So, @PERSON1, next time you want to talk to someone out of state on the phone, think about what you could do to save some money in this low economy. I know I said this before, but technology has gone so far, & is improving every step of the way.",8
358,"Advances in technology would have a positive affect on people. Think about it, computers could help hand eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places and people, and allow people to talk to other people online. Computers would most definetly be a positive affect on people. As mentioned, computers would help hand eye coordination. This is very important when playing a sport. Baseball for instince players need to catch a ball that is trying at them they need to be able to catch it. same when hitting. Computers would teach people to have hand eye coordination and they would want to go outside and play, which also is good exercise. Think about this with computers kids would instead of being home doing nothing be outside playing a sport just because they were on a computer. Dont you think computers are a good idea? Also a computer would help kids get better at typeing. This is not only good now but when they grow up and get used if that job is being a consultant for a company they will have to do alot of typing. If the person is not good at typing then they probably will get tired. If the person had a computer then when they grow up they will be a better typer and not get tired. Do you really want to see someone not get u job just because there were no computers? Computers help people succed in the life and its is all do to computers. Besides, hand eye coordination, computers give people the ability to learn about farway paces and people. The computer gives people the ability to serf the web to find out cool and interesting details about places that they would be able to unless they had a computer, The computer would give the person a whole sheet or more of details about the place or even a person. I remember last year I was wondering what does my country I was born in look like? I looked on the web and sure enough it gave me a whole buntch of pictures and details about my country. I would have never been able to find that with a book. Also the computer helps with school. The teacher might assigned a paper and has have to use a computer to find the information. If has don't have a computer then you just that assignment. The computer helps students get work done in there house and not in a library. Computer help in many ways but if helps learn which is one of the most things. Finally, the computer gives you an opportunity to chat to people online. Some people have friends that they dont know number and so when they go online and chat with them they get the number. Without to computer they would have never gotten the number. Also maybe you havent talked to someone in a longtime and now with online chat you can. In maybe you cant talk about something but you can write in type in the computer can let you with one of your best friends and then you can tell them and feel much better about yourself then it all in, computer is one cool machine and not only will it let you surf the web but it. Will give a chance to chat online with one of your best friends. To sum up, computers are a sofisticated machine but would have a positive affect people. They help people with hand eye coordination, give people to learn about faraway places and people and allow people to talk to each other online. The computer at first might seem like a bad idea but if young think positive it will turnout positive. The computer would most defitely affect the people in a good way. In any case like this is there? Really a bad side to having a computer?",10
359,"Now a days everyone has their own computer weather you share it with the family or not. People are spending more time on the computer then they are exercizing or getting outside. Most people dont realize it but they actually take away from family bonding time. I have to say they are helpful when it comes to homework. Since computers keep getting more and more advanced over the years, the games that you can play on them are incredible! But do you really want to stock inside all day on the computers? Instead, on the weekends or even in spare time, get outside and start exercizing. It is so much healthier to atleast go outside and kick the soccer ball around then to be inside with your eyes glued to the computer, playing some shooting game once you have been sitting on a chair all day and only moving your fingers around will only make someone lazier. Therefore they will have no desire or energy to get ou and be active. Do you like spending time with your family? Well, I know I love it once in a while. When people are up in their rooms playing games on their computer, they could be spending quality time wich their familys. Some people I know would rather stay in their rooms/houses or stay to be on their computers, but I know that I would much rather be outside with my family. Doesnt it get so boring to hear your family say how much fun they had and you werent there? I sure would get bored of ir. Next time someone says 'no' to some family bonding time, they should think about how much more fun it would be with them, then in your room. I have to say one thing, computers come in verry handy when it comes to homework. Say someone forgets there @CAPS1 text book at home, you can just log in to a website and there, your looking right at your text book but on the computer. If someone doesnt understand s homework assignment, you can just go right online and ask a friend how to do it, and instead of getting half credit, you will get full credit. I have done this alot of times, when you have to research something to understand it better, you use the computer for that too! There are plenty of ups and downs about computers, but I think that as long as you use your time wisely with computers, they come in verry handy.",8
360,"Dear The @ORGANIZATION1, I feel that computers are a good thing for our society, they help us answer everyday questions and research faster, they help us communicate with distant people and they make school work easier. These are just a few reasons on why I like computers and you should to. See, computers help us answer anything due tomorro on @PERSON1 but I left my text book at home. All I have to do is log on to google and search his name, More than @NUM1 websites pop up giving me enough information to do my assignment. @PERCENT1 of people agree with me that computers are very helpfull. however, reasearch is not the only thing computers can do for you @CAPS2 you are a member, of a social networking site like myspace or facebook or have a program like oovoo, then you can live message chat with anyone else using the site as well. some even offer video chat so you can have a conversation face to face while your in texas and your friend your video chatting with is in china. Computers bring the world together in an @CAPS1 way. Surprsingly,there is still more these amazing machines can do, @CAPS2 you have programs such as microsoft word than you can easily create essays and add fun pictures edited on your photoshop software and use screening effects and animations to make your project come to life. You can get your school work done faster, and then when you're done just e-mail it to your teacher then you dont have to worry about misplacing your assignment. I hope my information was a help to you, computers are an important part of oue lives the certanly shouldnt control them and constantly keep us away from family and friends, but they help us so much and can make working easier and more fun! thank you.",8
361,"Can you imagine a world without computers? People would have a hard time contacting one another, for business or pleasure. We would lose acess to music videos, and even games that entertain us. Most importantly, we would not be able to gain the knowledge and information a computer can provide. This is why I believe computers benefit society. As you know, computers allow communication. From email, to instant messaging, and even web cam chats. The computer is one of our key sources of communication. @PERCENT1 of @ORGANIZATION1 own a computer. @PERCENT2 use their computer to communicate for their job. They send memos, questions documents, and general information using email. Without computers we would have to send these things by mail which is much slower, and costs more. However, computer, can also be used to communicate with friends for fun. Computers provide great ways to connect with others. Computers also provide us with entertainment. With computers we have acess to music, videos, and games. Before computers radio was the easiest way to listen to music. The only problem was you would have to wait for the radio station to play the sing you wanted to hear. But with a computer all you need to do is buy it off of itunes for @MONEY1, and you can listen to it forever. You could even type the song name in on @ORGANIZATION2 and listen to it free from a safe trusted site. If you prefer radio you can listen to live streaming radio from your computer for free! Computers also provide videos for free. You could get on @CAPS1 and watch someone pull of a crazy stunt or watch a new hit music video. Or you could head over to a sports network site and watch the highlights from the big game you missed yesterday. You can even watch episodes of your favorite television shows for free. Computers even allow acess to free online games. One of the best ways computers are used is to find information. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 experts say the internet provides some of the best information available. This includes recipes, facts, maps, stories, and much more. For example, if you wanted to know ""how to change a tire"" all you need to do is search for it on @ORGANIZATION2, and plenty results will appear. Maybe you want to know about the customs of the @ORGANIZATION1. Again, all you need to do is search for it to instantly be provided with more information than you need. Why waste time searching through a book when you could have it instantly. Hopefully the reasons I have provided you have convinced you that computers benefit society. They allow communication, provide entertainment, and give acess to information.",10
362,"Dear local newspaper, Computers benefit society and have great effects on people for a few reasons. It is easier to type than to write, it increanses typing skills, and strengthens and helps hand and eye coordination in people. First of all, while some people find it easy to write by hand others might find it easier to type. It is more efficient to type on a computer than with a @CAPS1. Also if you use the computer it is faster if typing is a good skill that you might have. Some people don't know where they make a mistakes and @MONTH1 have to go back and. However on a computer, grammar and spelling errors are underlined and there is no erasing. You have to do just a button and your errors are fixed easily. The second reason why typing on a computer is better than writing by hand is it increases typing skills. People that have not used the computer can increase their skills.For example, where their fingers go and how @CAPS2 they can type. being used to writing with a @CAPS1 all the time it could be different using a computers especially if computers were not invented back in the day. It could be a change for People who writing with a than setting on the command using a keyboard to type. The final reason why computer is more efficient than by @CAPS1 is hand and eye coordination. People who have trouble using the computer. It helps your eyes follow the screen and your more across this keyboard. The wrap it up, I personally think that an increase in typing, being easier than writing and hand and eye coordination nuse you have to write something to think your and try using the it really helps.",8
363,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 opinion is that computers have a positive effect on people. Primarily, @CAPS3 teaches hand-eye coordination. This skill is very useful to every one throughout their life. Also, @CAPS3 allows people to learn about far away places and see what they look like with out paying for the trip. Moreover, @CAPS3 allows everyone to connect with family who live far away. As you can see, computers play a huge role in society today. To begin, computers teach hand-eye coordination. Not only will this skill be needed to use computers but allso durring every day life. Personally, I think that @CAPS3 is great kids start learning how to type at a young age. ""I am only @NUM1 years old and I allready have @CAPS1 typing skills mastered,"" said @CAPS2. That is very impressive because mostly elderly people don't have that ability. The reason for that is they did not have that type of technology. What I find interesting is about @PERCENT1 of people from that generation are just starting to catch on to computers. Actually, @CAPS1 opinion is just begining to understand. For christmas @CAPS1 parents bought her a laptop. Some times when we are visiting her I help to teach her. Pretty soon she will be sending out emails just as fast as kids @CAPS4 now. @CAPS3 is like she missed the train and is trying to. To continue, computers allow acess to the world. part of the day is spent talking and dealing with face to face. By using the computer you can see and talk to relatives and friends that live far away. The ""webcam"" is a great invention because @CAPS3 enables you to actually see the person on the other end. @PERSON1 said, ""@CAPS3 is so cool to be able to see @CAPS1 grandparents. We used to only visit once or twice a year because they live in @LOCATION1, but now we see them atleast once a week!"" @CAPS4 you see the benifits to using computers on a daily basis? I agree that the amount of time spent on them should be kept to a mininum, but in @NUM2 minutes a day really going to effect peoples life styles that much? To summarize, computers are an exellent idea. They introduce new skills to children that can be used every day. They can put these skills to use when they are one get jobs. Physically you are preparing palm fox entering the work force. Also, they help us learn new information on just about anything. Research has became a ""snap"" in other words @CAPS3 is quite simple. Finally, they enable us to keep in touch with relatives who live far away. These amazing machines are our future, so why not embrace @CAPS3? Thank you for listening.",9
364,"Dear Local Newspaper, I have recently heard that you are searching for solid oppinions on the effects @MONEY1 computers. Mainly, oppinions on whether they are good or bad. I know for a fact that the help computers provide has become an essential for most @MONEY1 the people in @LOCATION1. Computers provide entertainment in all catagories, including games, videos and so much more. ""@ORGANIZATION1"" is a search-engine on the internet that has @MONEY1 @MONEY1 links and addresses that bring you where you need to go. The website is like thousands @MONEY1 newspapers, phone books, encyclopedias, and dictionaries combined. Not to mention how much the modern computer helps at even the simplest @MONEY1 jobs. The computer is a neccesary tool for assistance in life. Most people think that computers are making children these days overweight. The computer does just a few more things than the television. The television has videos and movies. It also has the internet and games when a video game console is wired to it. If any case, televisions are doing just as much damage, if not more! I can guess that more than ninety percent @MONEY1 homes in @LOCATION1 have at least one computer or laptop with internet. A computer with internet is a gateway to various kinds @MONEY1 wonderful things. You can talk to friends through social messaging networks or by looking at them via video conference. There are hundreds @MONEY1 popular video game website. Shopping online has become very popular. ""@CAPS1 and @CAPS2"" even allows you to buy grocceries from home on their website. You @CAPS3 is a website where anybody can post videoes about anything! All these different helpful and entertaining tools have been said, but I haven't even talked about the number one! @ORGANIZATION1 is a website where you type in something, for instance, ""video game"", and thousands @MONEY1 results will pop up with websites, advertisements, maps, definitions, videos and other things. You name it and @ORGANIZATION1 has it. @ORGANIZATION1 is the number one most famous website in the world. It make @MONEY1 a year from around the world. @ORGANIZATION1 buys, sells, has videos, pictures, maps, links, advertisments, e-mails, recipies, phone numbers, measurements, translations, definitions, and so much more that if I continued I would have gone about three more lines down. @ORGANIZATION1 is amazing. After reading about my point @MONEY1 view on computer, I hope that you can now see through my eyes. Computers are efficient, helpful, entertaining, and just plain awesome.",10
365,"Dear ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3,"" Some experts believe that computers persuade people to stay indoors, and not go outside to play. I do not agree with this. First of all using computers is the number one way to communicate. Secondly, reading or watching @CAPS3 on line could be more helpful then reading a newspaper. Lastly, games people play on a computer are fun, but they can @CAPS4 help with a persons hand-eye coordination and reflexes. These are three ways that computers have a positive effect on people. When @NUM1 people were surveyed @PERCENT1 of them said they used the computer to communicate with friends, family, and coworizers. One way to communicate online is e-mail. E-mail is used everywhere for sports teams, jobs, school, etc. My mother can't go a day with out checking her e-mail. On her email is @CAPS3 about me and my brothers sports, our school, my family, and my mom's job. Email is mainly used by aduldts. Kids, such as myself, use social networking sights. For example: facebook, twitter, and myspace. I have a facebook and it is so helpful. I'm able to communicate with friends with out having to call them. Some of my friends don't have phones, so facebook is where I get to talk to them. Computers are useful for communication, but @CAPS4 for learning about local, national, and world @CAPS3. Going out to buy newspaper can be a. The cost of them can start to add up, and it @MONTH1 not always give people the information they want. Reading @CAPS3 online is so much simplier. It is extremly easy to go to a website that has @CAPS3 and find a topic you want to read about, @CAPS4, there are vidios and color pictures on a computer that there aren't in a newspaper. Looking at pictures is a great way to get more out of an article. If somebody is reading an article, but can't picture what happened in their heads, photos are helpfull. Vidios are a fun and easyway to learn @CAPS3. There is often more information in a vidio than there is in an article. Reading @CAPS3 on the computer is only one way computers benifit society. The games on computers can be fun and helpful. Experts say that a person who played a game on a computer once a day for a month increased their hand-eye coordination by @PERCENT2. Just imagine if somebody did that for an entire year! I admit, some games don't help people as much as others but the ones that do can be so helpfull. One game that helps a person think is called mind-sweeper. In this game people of all ages are challanged to find the mines hidden in an area. This helps people pay attention and think carefully about what they are clcking. Playing games on a computers can aid someone if they would like to have better hand eye coordination or reflexes. Computers benifit society because they are the number one way people communicate, they are convinient when it comes to reading @CAPS3, and games on a computer can help with hand-eye coordination. I strongly believe that computers have a positive effect on people.",10
366,"My opinion about computers is that they help society stay up to date with their surroundings, Computers also allow us to stay in touch with family and friends and stay update with the local and global news. Its not the computers fault people wont go outside. Researchers claim ""computers are one of the main reasons for obesity and other health deffects."" I would like to know how is it the computers fault. It does not breath, I does not sleep, it doesn't eat. I has no organs. So how does the computer control the use? It doesn't. The people who sit at there computer all day cause there own problems by not getting up out of the chair and going outside or going to the gym. A computer is an in animate object therefor it cannot control the user. Even with a computer you can still interact with family and friends. Most people nowadays use emails to stay in touch. Emailing is now alot faster than regular mail. People also use only chats such as @CAPS1 or windows live. My favorite way to chat with friends and family is via skype. Skype is a video chat service that allows you to talk to anyone in the word at any given time or place. Computers do still allow you to interact with others. A some computer programs allow us do work easier. Programs like rosseta stone help learn languages. Search engines such as google, yahoo, or @CAPS2 helps us to find articles or pictures on certain subjects. They also allows us to find maps and get directions to places. Microsoft word, powerpoint, and excel helps us type up projects, create slide shows, and make spread sheets. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 kids in my class use these programs almost everyday to help with school and just for fun. Do you think we should use computers? Are they bad for us? Do you think they are benificial? In conclusion computers are very benificial to our everyday life. The allow us access to almost whatever we want to learn. Computers keep us in touch with family and friends in many different ways. I say leave the computers alone they are fine.",9
367,"Nowadays, every generation is becoming more and more obese. I think that a major contributor to this is computers. When you use the computer a lot, you spend less time enjoying nature, lose exersising time, and isolate yourself from your family and friends. Do you want society to progress like this? While you use the computer, you isolate yourself completely from the outside world. A study from the phycology department of @CAPS1 says that people who are addicted to the internet or other computer games are often estranged from the ones they love. It is a fact that visiting with your family can greatly improve your relationship with them. You @MONTH1 think well, I can talk and visit with my friends virtually, but what about when your family goes out to the movies or your friends are at the park. Do you want to isolate yourself in cyberspace? As almost everybody knows our weight situation. In the @ORGANIZATION1 is rapidly detirorating. Every new generation become fatter and fatter, like a farm of pigs. I think this is because of advances in technology, like computers. Now, on the computer you can play baseball, @CAPS2, tennis lacross, soccer, and any variety of sports. Instead of getting outside and playing. Kids are sustituting play on the computer for actual exersise. Sometimes, a kid's exersises cutshort because of the based computer games running their schedule. The more time spent on a computer, the less time spent exersising, playing sports, or doing other various activities in the real world not the virtual one. Another common problem that most everybody knows about is our failng eco-system. The more time spent on a computer, the less outside enjoying nature. If you have your face studs to the moniter, you won't see all of the endangered species trying to survive and soon youll become different to the world. If we are going to save our world, we must get outside and work a lot the type of work you can do on a computer. I personally spend much more time outside, enjoying nature than my friends with their own computers. If a person can't see the cloud of a mog that hangs over and around cities, than how can they do anything to stop it? Now, I know that people in cities don't have much wildlife to enjoy, but we have not progressed to the where every tree every where a high-rise. Even from big cities like new york, it is only a short drive to nature, a short drive to truly living. Now think back. Do you want to be estranged? Do you want your children to be having heart attack age of ? Do you want to suffer directly from the ecosystem that will no longer  earst? If you do, then you should keep your face on the monitor, but I know that we can change starting with computers.",10
368,"Dear local Newspaper, the effects that computers have on people are crazy. Everyone around the world uses a computer to find something to research. Some of the websites you can actually talk to your friends! When people found out that you were able to communicate with your frends they talked for hours. The computer can also help you buy things off of the internet. But most of all, the computer has a huge effect on peoples jobs. If you are a real a toy you need to find out information on the house so you will be able to sell it to the customer. Jobs are really important. You need information about things to help you with your job. It can really effect your life if you lose your job by not getting information off the computer. Communicating online is also very helpful. If you get really bored one day you can go online and talk to your friends to see if they want to hang out. I have a connection to when I was in my house on the @DATE1 and I was really bored. So I went online and invited a friend over my house. Weather is another main issue. If you were to get stuck inside your house on a very rainy day and you have nothing to do, you can play games online. When it snows you play outside then come in and get warmed up then go on the computer. I think that on my opinion overall that playing on the computer is really popular for people around the world. Some games you can translate words so you can learn new languages! So even at home on the computer you can get a lot smarter by learning new languages from other people.",8
369,"Dear readers of the local newspaper, I agree that everyone is using computer nowadays, I think we should do something about it. One reason why I think computers are bad people is because you can't really trust the people in the computer. Another reason is computers are bad for your health, and lastly you don't spend time with your family if you're using the computer too much. First, you can't really trust people in the computer you meet them online and they can lie about everything and you won't even know this is bad if you're only @NUM1 and you're chatting with people you don't know. Yes, you want to make new friends over computer but who can you really trust these days? They can put up fake pictures and you won't want to fall into their trap. Second, I think computer are bad for yor health. They can burn your eyesight and can leave you blind @PERCENT1 of teenagerswho have used the computer for over @NUM2 hours now and need to get glasses because they can't see it. However, you can use the computer for an hour, it'll be fine, but if you use it more than @NUM3 to @NUM4 hours you @MONTH1 need to go to the doctors to check your eyesight. The brightness of the computer can also burn your. Lastly, you don't want the computer to affect you and your lifestyle. These are the three reasons why I think computers are bad for people. You can't trust anyone in the computer, it's bad for your health and thirdly it can affect your life. I hope that with this letter you might do something to help at those in need.",8
370,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects of computers is that they have a positive effect on people. The reasons why computers have a positive effect on people is because people learn new things, they can interact with their family and friends on a computer, and lastly because using moving the mouse on a computer is containing lots of muscles. One reason why computers have positive effects on people is because some people learn new facts everytime they go on the computer. It is very possible to learn new things on a computer everytime you go on a computer because computers contain lots of information. Learning new facts everytime you go on a computer is a good thing people always, say ""you learn something new everyday"". Everytime someone learns something new they are adding more information into their brain. When you add more ideas in your brain the more you know, and the more you know the smarter you are. Those are @CAPS1 reasons and details of why computers have positive effects on people. The second reason why computers have positive effects on people is because people can interact with their family and friends on a computer. Their are video cameras on laptops where you can view your family from out of the state and you can interact with them instead of traveling. When you use a video camera on a laptop you don't have to call. You do not have to go through so much with buying passports to see family and friends that are out of state when you can get in contact with them over a computer. That is another reason why computers have good effects on people. And lastly another reason why computers have good effects on people is because it takes lots of muscles to move the mouse all over the screen. When it contains muscles to do things it is considered exercizing to me because anything that a person does contains muscles. That is a good thing because exercising is good for you. So movements to a computer does contain exersize. That was the last reason of why computers have good effects on people. @CAPS1 position was stated wich was computers do have good effects on people.

371,"Computers are an object that have different opinions from different people. Some people think that @CAPS3 is a perfect use of time to go on the computer all day long, while some parents have time limits for their kids telling them how long they can go on the computer (and the x-box, or play station, @CAPS1, etc.) @CAPS2 that way, they won't have to sit there on a bright, sunny afternoon when they could go for a walk in the park. Companies use computers to make their time more useful to store what people bought, sold, with a click of a mouse and when they would need the information for a refund, click!, and there @CAPS3 pops up. The topic is @CAPS2 debateable that people could protest about @CAPS3. Here are some of the benefits from computers: @CAPS3 can have people save time by ordering online and delivering the item to their house, webcams can let people see others in the convience of their own homes, social networking sites and virtual worlds are another way for people to see each other, and more can be done in less time. Some people think that if you sit on the chair and use the computer all of the time, you might be tired, need a break, or just to go outside to get some fresh air. @CAPS3 can also make people obese and can cause them to die. My opinion is that computers are convient, but they should be used sparingly because they can cause problems in your social life, educational life, etc. I also think that people should use the computer for a purpose, and not spread viruses, worms, trojan horses, or anything like that. Computers have benefits like having time savers on @CAPS3 or can be a defect to your normal life. But, I think that computers are good. This concludes my essay.",8
372,"Dear Newspaper, I think that people should be able to spend as much time on a computer as they went. While they're on the computer they can tak with friends or do school assinments. People can also learn a lot of important facts as well. Being on the computer can keep kids out of trouble. And the computer can be very helpful to all. In this paragraph I'll tell you how being on the computer can be good for people. One way the computer can help is by printing out an important photo like of a family member or freind. Another way the computer can help is by having younger kids play educational games that help with spelling, math, or reading, A third way the computer can help is by letting us chat with friends that live far far away. Next, I'll tell you about how kids might need the computer for doing class asingments. It can print out an essay at last minutes notice. The computer can send the essay to a teachers email. Or maybe the'll need to quickly type something up for something else. The computer can also allow people to email their lapher! and tell them why they coudn't complete an asignment. Finally, I'll tell you about how the computer can keep kids out of troble and how it helps adults as well. Being on the computer can kids out of bad situations like peer presure, smoking, or doing something bad kids can ba safley at home instead. If kids are always at side playing and running around they could get hurt or break a bone, maybe even hurt someone else, The computer can help out adults as well because people can purchase items that they need. Another it can help is because business owners can check stocks or the. Some can compare the price of different stores. This concludes my letter on how computers can be helpful. Rember the the @LOCATION1 can help a bit. The kids out of trouble. Teach a lot of educational things. And do school assinments.",8
373,"Evrey year inventors come up with new desings of computers. They always improve and atract customers from @NUM1 years old to a grown adults. Computers can be used for alot of needed things, but after the years people have taken advantage of them. Kids all over spend hours siting on the computer. These computers can be very dangerous to these young kids. Also @CAPS1 people just sit around for hours and dont exercise your body it can become very unhealthy. Also it takes peopel away for the more important things in life. For my first reason, I am stateing that it is very dangours for kids to have a opening to evreything there is in the world. Kids are talking to strangers whitch can result to a bad ending. There are so many syber avenders that just wait for a young kid to come around and talk to them. They end up coming them to do things that they shouldn't be doing. There have been so many crimes that have to do with kids and the internet. Kids spend way to much time on the open internet. Kids and adults spend hours on computers. Its ussaly for pointless things. They sit there when they could be outside excirsising or go to a gym. They could be doing somthing as thats good. For their health. Many kids and adults have been oveweight due to the lack of exercis. One of the main reasons why is because of them siting around on a computer for so many hours doing nothing. They get so focused on what they are doing on the computer they never have time to get up and exercis their bodys. My last reason that I think computers have been taken advantage of is because it takes time away for more imporant things. It takes away from things like Family, Friends, @CAPS2 work, and alot more. @CAPS1 people spend all this time on computers they will grow apart from family and friends. Also kids will not have time to do homwork and their grades will drop. Geting into colledges to start a life is way more important then doing pointless activities on the computer. Now you know all my reasons why I think computers have been taken advantage of adults and kids are taken away from the more important things in life. Also for kids very dangourus. Lastley people are beoming overweight due to spending time on computers. Thats why I think computers have been taken advantage",9

375,"Dear @CAPS1, I know computers might seem helpful but in the hands of a teen, preteen or child they are not in thoose hands children become mindless zombies. They stay away from family don't sleep and you never know what there doing. First off, even though we have all this technology minors abuse @CAPS4. They could do realy nastey things ok. You never know, for all they know they probably talking to some @NUM1 year old pervert! Would you know?

(note never let cildren got'n @LOCATION1 they will be abducted) @CAPS3 reason is children become adicted to the computer they will never come to you. Listen I know a friend the only comes outside once a year because he stays at home playing a computer game! He was @CAPS2 adicted hand to tie him up to go outside @CAPS4 was truly awful how pale and barely he was I puked. @CAPS2 at least try grounding them from @CAPS4 or locking them away from @CAPS4. My third final reason is kids will just truly get hooked and will fall school. They will just cease living normaly they some how feed of of technology. @CAPS4's really glue some never let this happen everthis is your last warning. @CAPS2 nows the time to act don't let this happen curb your children now unless you wait a future of nothingness. Its time to act unless you wanting have your child get taken into that anarchy!",8
376,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I firmly support advances in technology. I feel that computers have placed a positive effect on us. Imagine a mother sitting at home chatting with distant friends. Suddenly, her daily calendar pops up, reminding her to go to the gym for one hour today. If she didn't have this gentle reminder, she would probably forget to get her daily excersize in printout directions to the gym would be helpful as well how could she get this done? With a click of a button, thanks to technology. New @CAPS1 @CAPS2 magazine states that @PERCENT2 of people living in @LOCATION2 own a computer! communication devices such as @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS5, and @CAPS8 @CAPS9 class finders have been key tools to today's socialization. To discontinue technology advances is like halting the creation of new types of food. Eventually, it'll get boring! Bringing old friends together through this tool can change your life in so many ways! Maybe you'll find a close friend, or possibly a spouse you would've never even considered @CAPS6 websites like @ORGANIZATION2 and @LOCATION1 have created marraiges that improved individuals lives @PERCENT1. Computers move like lightning! You can go from writing a report on the roman @CAPS7 t the history of @LOCATION3 almost instantaneously! Youth has taken advantage of this, showing elders how fascinating computers are. Furthermore, computers have given us many choices in order to create documents. Important files can look professional within a matter of seconds.

In summation, I feel computers have a positive effect on humans, toddlers to adults and senior citizens. Advances in technology are critical to keep the world functioning as it is! Don't take this precious privlidge away from us, before the newborn baby in that mothers arms has even experienced it ! I implore you to continue making technology advances each and every day.",10
377,"Dear lacal newspaper, I wrote this letter to state my opinion on the effects computers have on people. I think it gives people the ability to talk to their family and friends from far away places. They get a chance to meet new people and hae fun with it. One reason is because you night have your family far away from you and you never get a chance to see them; so your best choice is the computer. I know that some people are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and not enjoying nature. But just think about it some people just like to be in the house and just have time for themselves @CAPS1 reason is because it helps your kids learn more about life and nature, it also helps them learn about faraway places, places they have never sint in life. Enjoying nature can be dangerous. more than @PERCENT1 of the people in this world get hurt exploring new things and places. You can't force somebody to leave the computer benine. If thats what they like being in their house and not trying new things well its up to them it's their life not yours. The third reasone is because there are social skills, leassons and activities kids can try out on a computer. Things they can't do in the real world. Adults have a chance to find friends from their high school years in facebook and get a chane to talk about how are they doing in life today. Remember that you @MONTH1 be concerned about the people spending more time in the computer but some bad things @MONTH1 be good things and good things @MONTH1 come out to be bad things.",8
378,"Dear @CAPS1 I think computers do keep people from going outside and exercising. People have to much fun playing online, checking their email and listening to music on the web. When they should be out side having fun. Parents should spend time keeping their child outside they can sign them up to a sport, take them to the beach or to the park. As long as their child is not on the computer. Parents im sure you you want you children healthy so get them out side to exercise. Also keep your kid @CAPS2 if they are bored you can buy them a toy to play with outside, keeping them away from the computer. You can also take them on a bike or camping. Computers should not be used all the time. So remember you can sign yor kid up on a sport, take them biking, go to the beach, buy them an outside toy or take them to the park. ",6
379,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, The people of @LOCATION1 need to use their computers. Computer users in @LOCATION1 need to use their computers on a daily bases. To do research on projects, online assistaints, communicate with friends and family, and for entertainment purposes. About @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 uses computers a day to do what they need to get done. What my point is that the people of @LOCATION1 can't live without computers. Major boltom as well agree with me. He even said,""that hewould be lost without his computer."" Computers just making things easier to do know a days. Today computers are used to do your homework online, buy things without leave your house, and help map quest places you want to go. In fact, studys show that @PERCENT2 of @LOCATION1 says that computers make work a whole faster to do. We all know that computers help teach hand-eye coordination and give you a chance to learn about faraway places. The more you use your computers the more you learn. Learning is what gets us great jobs. The more you know the better of a job you will have. Computers are a possitive thing, not negative. Many kids that are young know more about computers then their parents. This is a positive thing because kids can use the computer for homework help. Also, parents can turn to a computer for help with just about anything. Most of @LOCATION1 arees that using a computer daily is important.

Computers can help alot expecialy with homework @PERCENT1 of teens use the interact whether its for research or homework for science computers have been helping the world for years and many to come. If you didn't know teachers assign online home work instead of handing out thoustands of papers and if you dont have a computer it sucks to be you. Thats why computer have a positive effect. Computers can be used for community with Friends. this is done by many teens and adults. Say you have a friend who moved out of, You want to call them but you dont have long distance calling. how your stuck wait you friends has a @CAPS2, you create one and add then as a friend. this is free and so are most other things like aim, myspace, and yahoo. this is how computers can be used to communicate. Computers can be used to learn new things. There are many things you can learn from computers. From languages to a new recepi. there is this program called @PERSON1, it is used to learn new languages, @CAPS3 year my sister wanted to learn french, so she download it on her computer, now she can speak @CAPS4 sentences.

382,"Dear editor, I agree with your position about computers being used to much that people dono't wan't to get a chance to go outside. Here are @NUM1 reasons why I agree. The @CAPS1 reason why I agree with this position is not interacting with family and friends I say this because, some of the people that use the computer get more adicted everyday they wont talk with people. Another issue is that the computers can get more enjoyable for the user's. For example, new games, web sites and even job applications. As you can see these sorts of things get very addicting to kids to adults. The second reason why I agreed to this position is exercising I think this because in ways the human body needs an amount of exercising each and everyday. In other words if a user sits on a chair all day and he or she always getsclose to the computers screen that can hurt your body without you even noticing. Another way use'rs should exercise is to motivates them selves to have some strenghth in their life. For example - if user's dond't get much exercise it can cause problems to their body like asthma, dihabites, or cancer and there are more. The third reason why I agree to this position is eating because user's get to concentrated on the computer they sametimes dono't get to eat as offen as they did before.",7
383,"Dear newspaper, I believe that people spend too much time on the computer. Most people nowadays ""talk"" through e-mail, but instead, they should be face-to-face talking with each other. Also, being outside is much better for you, because your body needs things like @CAPS1 @CAPS2 from the sun. Lastly, there could be bad things on the @CAPS3, like websites that could send viruses to your computer. As you can see, these are all the reasons why I believe that the computer can be dangerous. ""@CAPS4"" with people through the @CAPS3 is not healthy. First of all, it decreases people's ability to make conversations. Statistics clearly show that about @PERCENT1 of people who talk with other people over e-mail have trouble talking and making good conversations with other people in the real world. Second of all, when people talk through e-mail, they're basically having a conversation with their computer rather than with an actual person, and this is not healthy. Lastly, talking with people over email can be addictive, and you might lose track of time and end up staying on the computer for hours. During this time, you should be outside getting fresh air or running around! Being outside is very important. The sun gives your body @CAPS1 @CAPS2, which is a @CAPS1 needed in the process of digesting proteins. Also, being outside gives you fresh air. This is essential because your body needs natural, fresh air to stay healthy. Staying inside all day isn't good for you, because then you're just breathing in stuffy air. Finally, being outside gives you exercise. I know whenever I go out for a run, I feel great because getting vitamins, fresh air, and fantastic exercise. Lastly, people shouldn't go on the computer as much because there could be bad things on the @CAPS3. For example, in certain websites, there could be viruses that the website sends to your computer. I remember one time, our computer was completely locked up, so we couldn't go to the @CAPS3 or @ORGANIZATION1 word or any of our icons, so we had to get a professional to come to our house and fix our computer for us. Also, there could be inappropriate things on the @CAPS3 that young children shouldn't see. Lastly, there could be some websites that cause your computer to respond very slowly or freeze. This is why people shouldn't waste all their time on the computer! So I believe that people should go on the computer less frequently because ""@CAPS4"" with people through e-mail is not the healthy, being outside is much better for you, and the computer could have bad things.

384,"Dear local Newspaper, Computers are becoming a problem with kids these days and how they are constantly on them kids abuse their privelouses of using their computers. They also usually have too much freedom with their computers using it whenever they want. Seven out of ten kids between the ages ten through sixteen spend at @TIME1 day on their computer. This is a problem that needs to stop so kids can exercise more and be active. sometimes the reason kids are on the computer so much is their parents don't care how long their kids are using electronics instead of getting freshair and enjoying the outdoors. One of my friends is on the computer as soon as he gets off the buss so he can look at things he wants to buy. These kids need to start being outside more. Kids are constantly abusing their privelauges on their computers. An example of this all too common problems when the childs @CAPS1 is at work they go on the computer when they are suppose to be doing something like homework orchores. The kids in this time are too attached to their electronics and the ""can't"" live without them. Most adults let their children use their computer or the family computer whenever they want to without being supervised. now I'm not saying that the child is going to be irresponsible with their freedom but don't you think that that is way too much freedom? with all the time the kids aren't doing homework or something that actually needed to be done on the computer the kids could be spending time with friends, playing sports, or some other fun outdoor activity. As you can see, kids in this day and age abuse their technology way too much. Whether it's how much time they spend on the computer, their privelauges on the computer, or even the freedom the kids have on the computer. The kids need to learn to be more active and healthy, this is why I am against the time kids are using their technology for leisure instead of something they need.",8
385,"Dear Newspaper, Computers don't hurt people, they help them. They have many benefits. People don't even spend all day on the computer, they help us learn new things, and they help doctors and scientists cure diseases. As you can see computers help the world. People do not spend all day on the computer. Lots of people spend most of the day outside swimming, playing games, and walking in the @DATE1 and @DATE2. Whenever I go to the beach, it's always packed! However, some people do spend all day on the computer but thats a small part of the population. Computers do benefit the world! If we didn't have computers, now would we talk with family members who live far away? Some people have family and friends who live in different places then they do. They use computers to talk with them. For example, my family and I would not be able to see my @CAPS1 as often as we would like to if we couldn't talk with her on the computer. In other words, I wouldn't be able to see my @CAPS1 if computers wern't around. Another reason computers benefit society is it teaches you things that you otherwise woudn't know! Have you ever heard someone say ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 it""? If we didn't have computers we woudn't be able to look up things or do projects at home. Computers have made people smarter! Computers help save lives. If doctors didn't have computers they might not be able to help cure people. What would happen if police didn't have computers? They woudn't be as organized and they might not be able to catch criminals. Police and doctors might nor be able to test @CAPS5 or fingerprints as accuratly. If scientists didn't have computers they might not be able to cure some diseases. What if someone got a disease that with computers scientists coud cure, but they coudn't because there wasnt any computers? In conclusion, computers help save lives, cure disease, and catch criminals. Computers help the world! First people don't even spend that much time on computers. Second, computers help teach people, and keep family and friends connected. Lastly, computers help doctors, police, and scientists. As you can see, the world is a much better place with computers.",9

With computers, we are able to talk with far away friends and family, research and about things fast, and we can even buy plane tickets and book vacations. Just think about it; without computers, where would we be today? If you have friends or family far away, you probably know what a hassle it is to house phone cards in order to talk to them. They cost money and you have to enter lots of different numbers. With computers, you can talk to them free, online, and you @CAPS2't even have to call them. If something happens to a family member of yours, the fastest way for everyone to find out is to just send an e-mail to them and you @CAPS2't have to each person seporatly.

Not only can you talk to people, but you can also research on things and find out what is happening all around the world, almost instantly. On computers, you can research on all different topics, and even find out things for a school project. You can also find out the news, weather, and what is happening all over the world. If there is a school project and you need to research the topic, the most efficiant way is to use the computer. It has the most information and it is the fastest way to learn about that topic. Not only that, but you can even look up the weather reports for all over the world, news and what is happening allover. the computer is great for this, but you can also look vacations on it! Do you want to go on vacation, but @CAPS2't know how to learn about the different places you can go to first? On computers, you can book vacations, and even buy plane tickets. You can look on line for resorsts and hotels, and book a room in advance. You can even see all your different options for places you can stay. Not only that, but you can buy plane tickets. Without having to go through too much troubles, you can buy plane tickets; online! You can even just look at prices and times if you want too. And it's the fastest way!

388,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 all over the world use computers, but not everyone agress that this benefits the society. In my opinion, ever since computers came out, @CAPS2 need to spend quality time with there family. Computers have made a huge effect on people. Grown people have depended on there computer to find everything and the websites have come to there attention so they get attached to the computers. As for students, they also get attached to these websites such as myspace, youtube, facebook, etc. i think its good to use your computer once in a while instead of all the time. Some students end up getting jumped over online talking. Some grown ups just sit around all day interacting with people on the computer and don't interact with there kids. In my opinion, people should go outside more and hang out or go out with there kids. Why sit around all day on the computer and have online coversations with ramdom people when you can go outside and hang out with your friends. it has came to my attention that some paretnts avoid these kids and don't want to listen to what they have to say because there so into the computer. Children also like to start trounble with people online and then kids get hurt over something that was said. I would .like to see more people going out then staying home on a computer. People get fat and don't care. Some people are addicted to there computer and can't let it go. I hope that you agree with me and make change.",8
389,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 you know that @PERCENT1 of doctors think that it is better to go outside then to sit inside and go on the computer? It's definatly better for you. I think that people are spending to much time on the computer and not enough time doing other things. They should be hanging out with family and friends, getting out of the house and not forgetting about important things. I hope you will listen to my reasons for this. My first reason is that when your on the computer, it's taking away time to spend with your friends or your family. When your on the computer and your so sucked in your not spending enough time with your friends or family. Instead of comming home from school and going onto the computer, make plans with your friends and go do something. Instead of going on the computer, make plans to do something with your family, like go out for ice-cream or something. Just don't go on the computer. You do nothing when your on the computer, which @MONTH1 have a result of falling asleep or getting yelled at to get off. Another reason I have is that when your on the computer, time flys by so fast, you don't even realize it. Then, you loose track of time. Sometimes, people get so sucked in, that they forget that they have homework or need to study for a test. It @MONTH1 be important to do your homework before you get sucked in, then you want have to about doing it after you loose track of time. Some parents @MONTH1 even get sucked info, and that might be bad to because who's going to make you dinner? My last and final reason is that you need to get out! If you sit, in a chair, in a stuffy room, stairing at a screen, that's just not good. Just picture it, it dosn't look very good. Getting out is a really good thing to do in your life. It's a big part of it. It's one thing that keeps you nice and healthy. When you get out you are doing things that make you happy. Like, hanging out with friends or doing fun things with your family. Sitting inside on a beautiful day, dosn't that make you sad? Wouldn't you want to go outside instead of sitting and playing around on the computer? These were some of the reason why I think that people are spending to much time on the computer. Doing this can cause some seriuos problems like not spending time with family and friends, forgetting about major things, and not getting out enough. These are major issues. I definately think that people are spending way to much time on the computer. Thanks for listening.",10
390,"Dont you think computers are not a waste of time? Well I mean if you think about it, computers have a very large effect on people. For example, kids and teenagers spend more time on the @CAPS1 thatn doing their homework. Also teens stay uplate at night and chat with their friends or people don't even know! Lasly, computers are not healthy because teens would rather sit in front of a computer than exercising. Well, as we all and most on their thime on the @CAPS1 doing their. For example, kids would go on the computer and tell there parents they don't, do. and kids also on the @CAPS1 watching think what could be spending more time doing their homework. Lastly, most teens and big test that they need to study for. But, what they would rather do is on the @CAPS1. Teenagers just love to their don't on school days we all know teenagers and watch televison and the. If you think about it, late wake up and early the next day. Also, most teens chat with thier friends online. For example, because planty not tot the where their time. Lastly, I must that computers are for teens at all! Many should agree! This is because teenagers used to sit in front of a computer. Rather than ! We also know that a lot of teens @CAPS2. You @CAPS2 sports you hsould spend times on the computer and practice on getting ! Computers are their taking time out from the fresh air and being with your friends at the or even time mall! Yup ! S you I think all agrees. Next computers in a have on teens and. Thier are many ",8
391,"Dear @CAPS1, I agree that spend more time on a computer than work outor do other things like cleaning his/her home or room. Anther reson is if you are on a computer talk to someone you mite not know who they are or how old they mite be be. @CAPS2 last reson why is more people needs to excercis then its on a computer all day @CAPS2 first reson was he or she how to clean there room or house because if you stay on a computer you will never time to clean you meat someone online and if they come over they mite not want to stay with you because your to clean and @CAPS2 last reson is if you dont have a clean house you can find games or for the computer. @CAPS2 reson was you mite know what are they are who they are because if you ask these because you are talking to online to come over they mite be a killer or a rapist. Plus if you talk to that person everyday you or they mite be come with each other. If you mite be driven crazy for that person and crazy stuff. @CAPS2 last reson for this message is to excercis because if you are on a computer all day you will never have to exercis. Or if you yoo can't be active like playing baseball. So when you do get off ther computer and go play baseball you will be slow or not even want to play at all. Iam in conclusion computers are good to have but not the last thing to do all day because you will not be able to clean your house, you mite talk to all killer or not be to work out and be fit @CAPS3 you for reading.",8
392,"Dear newspaper, I think that computers have a positive effect on people. They have a positive effect on people because @CAPS1 gives them important information. Also that they can talk to family members or friends. Another thing is that @CAPS1 is really fun and @CAPS1 is a good exercise for their fingers. First of all, the computer gives them important information, @CAPS1 helps them learn about the history of different places that they didn't know about. Also that if kids needed help on their homework they could use the computer to help them. Another thing is that @CAPS1 help people learn about the news and what is happining. Second of all, the computer allows them to talk to family members and friends. They could send pictures to there friends or family members. Another thing that they can do is see each other online. Also @CAPS1 is good way to keep in touch with there family members. Last but not least, the computer is really fun and at the same time a helpful exercise. They could play lots of games such as racing, baseball and many others online. Also that they could put there pictures online. @CAPS1 is also a good exercise because when they type they use the fingers which is a good exercise. In conclusion, computers are a positive effect on people because @CAPS1 gives them important information, they can talk to family members and friends, and its fun and great exercise at the same time. Please think about my opinion before you make the decision.",8
393,"Dear @CAPS1 - @CAPS2, @CAPS3 you think the internet is useful and beneficial to the community? Recently, it has been brought to my attention that @LOCATION1 civilians disagree. Without a doubt, I firmly believe that their thoughts are ludacris. The internet allows people to interact with distant friends and family members. The world wide web also helps people relax and is convenient. First of all, the internet allows people to interact with distant friends and family members. Not to long ago, my mother and i joined www.@CAPS4.com. Since our friends and family never pick up the phone, we thought chatting on the internet might be a good idea. When we both signed up, we found out that our entire family is on @CAPS4 and they are glued to it almost all day! Now, instead of having voicemail messages and not talking, we can talk to (or type to) them anytime & place! Secondly, the internet helps people relax. You could hop on the computer and play a game that pulls you into another demension and forget about the stress you endured that day. In recent studies, @PERCENT1 of participants agreed that their body and mind felt renewed and replenished. My mother and father even agree! Combined, my parents work almost twenty hours a day and the computer helps them their troubles. Thirdly, the computer is very convenient. Before people by stop and shop was invented, my family would hate shopping. Now, supermarkets are taking this idea and its become enjoyable to shop. Also, some older folk and handicapped people @MONTH1 not be able to go shopping or out at all. Thanks to the internet and their amazing ideas, life is much easier for them! Computers and the internet are two fabulous inventions. They make it easier to communicate with friends and family, relax, and make things more convenient. If not for the internet, life would be rough harder than it is. Please take my opinion seriously and agree with portion of the population that is for computer usage!",8
394,"Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, I think that computers are a waste because nobody likes to go out & exercise anymore for example instead of going outside & playing baseball they stay inside, turn on the computer & play baseball on the internet instead of going out & getting some fresh air. Another example why computers are bad is when you chat online you sometimes dont know who you are talking too. That is how people are getting kidnapped now because they're trusting these online. When people their pictures online they dont know who is looking at them. The internet is a great thing but everything good always comes to a end. The internet is a part of our society but every now & then we have to cut it off cause one know People today think that computers are ways to meet new people & learn new things so dont you read a book or go outside & explore but that is just my opinion I hope you agree to.",6
395,"Dear @CAPS1 Time I strongly beleave that computers can only help us and can do no wrong. As we all know by now the world around us is changing and changing for the better I think computer are basically the key to the online world with it anything can be done. The computer can help you comunicate with family and freinds from all over the world, it is a faster and easier way to learn and it computers are helping business get to consumers. Family is one of the most important thing to me and I think it is for most people to. Families offen dont live in the same town state or even country as each other. For example my family is from @LOCATION3 and @CAPS2 to @LOCATION1 but one of my uncles live in @LOCATION2 a @NUM1 hour drive from were I live. So as yo can imagine we dont see each other often @MONTH1 be twice a year. So for siblings who have grown of with each other that is no ebough so many of my uncles communicat through @CAPS3. Computers are also a key to education, so why not unlock the door. When soemone has acsese to computers at tjeir home it is live a cortable library. Also it makes things much easiers to do such as going to dictionary, con instead of looking up a word. Their will also be a end to that question I didind understand the homework the internet can provide you with the answers you need. Consider computers and education a advancement in our system of learning. Computers also help buisnesses. Buissnesses have always been triang to get to his consumer. Throug comercials, sighns even walking up to your door and telling you what to buy now computers have a new world of consumers. What well known buisness do you know of that dont have there own website @CAPS1 publick schools even have thers own site, so everyone is steping up. So in conclusion you see that compers are a key to the world after reading this I hope you share my point of view. Computers are help learn communicate and share your ideas.",8

This is why I would like to talk about weather or not computers have a positive effect on @CAPS8. In @CAPS6 opinion I @CAPS7 Computers have a negative effect. On @CAPS8. In @DATE2 The average @CAPS10 was not @CAPS9. But today however More than @PERCENT3 of @CAPS10 are overweight or @CAPS9, @CAPS11 no, schools do not have a positive effect on @CAPS8 because they cause a @CAPS15 of exercise less time enjoying nature, and less time interacting with family and friends. The average @CAPS10 between the ages of @NUM1 get less than @CAPS12 hour of exersise a day. I myself usally fal under That statistic myself. on average a spend about @NUM2 hours each day on a computer. @CAPS30 this @CAPS13 is why many experts are blaming computers @CAPS30 The @CAPS14 in obeseity and @CAPS15 of exersise. @CAPS11 twenty years from now what will happen to @CAPS16 @CAPS17 if we don't act now. Next is that computers cause people to spend less time enjoying nature. According to A @CAPS18 statistic The average visit to a national park has droped by @PERCENT4, and the average vist to local park's has droped by @PERCENT5. Me myself is part of that statistic aswell. When @CAPS6 boyScout troop goes on a campout I find myself more to stay home rather then venture out into the woods with @CAPS6 friends. Lastly computers cause people to spend less time with @ORGANIZATION1. A personal @CAPS19 is @CAPS6 cousin @PERSON1. In @CAPS6 opinion he isn't the smartest person @CAPS20 but he's ok. But @CAPS20 sence he start playing @CAPS21 of warcraft, @CAPS22 time I vist him he basly comes out of his room. In fact there was a kid Who spent @CAPS11 @CAPS24 on his computer that his mom had to bring his food @CAPS11 he could eat. But he was @CAPS11 @CAPS26 on his game online that he deid of dyhydration. @CAPS11 no, computers do not have a good effect on @CAPS8 because they cause people to spend less time with Family and @CAPS27 which overall lead them to become anti-social, @CAPS28 is a major contribution to our nation @CAPS15 of exercise witch ultimatly leads to obeseity, and @CAPS28 causes people to spend less time enjoying nature. @CAPS11 what are you waiting @CAPS30 go out there and spread the word about computers.",10
397,"Dear Newspaper, I belive that computers have a positive, effect on people. The are a great way to save time as technology continues advancing. Also, they make people happier. they can even help you to expand your knowledge on any given subject. Clearly, computers have a positive effect on people, and help people every day. The first reason why I believe that computers have a positive effect on people is because using them is a great way to save time. Paying taxes used to be a very time consuming thing that people have to do every year. But, now that computers exist to help people pay taxes easily, it takes a lot less time to do so. In fact, it has been proven that people, who use computers to pay their taxes spend only @PERCENT1 of the time that people who don't have computers spend on doing their taxes. Also, computers can help you save time when you type. Whenover you write a document for school or for a job, typing is a much. It has been proven that people who type their papers instend of than finish must. As you effect on people computers have positive effect on people use them make people happier. Computers are very advanced technology and include fun games to play and endless amounts of websites. With computers, you have to many opportunities. You can create your own website by just the click of a button or became an alien in space in your favorite online game. You can even catch up on a television show you might have missed the night before and watch it with no commercials. It is also a know fact that @PERCENT2 of people who own computers are generally more happy than people who do not own computers. Therefore, computers have a positive, effect on people is because they can help you to expand your knowledge. Any fact that you @MONTH1 want to know about anything from ancient @CAPS1 to which athletes are cometing in the next @DATE1 olympics can be found on computer. If you wanted to, you could learn an entire language just from your computer. In fact, @PERSON1, the owner of a very popular computer campany called @ORGANIZATION1 once said:""Computers are a gatewawy to knowledge."" I believe that this statement is true. Also studies show that @PERCENT3 of the average person's knowledge comes from things they learned from a computer. So, computers have a positive effect on people. To conclude, computers have a positive effect on people because they are a great way to save time, they make people happier, and they can help to expand your knowledge on any given subject. Clearly, computers are a huge advantage in life and would be hard to live without. I hope that the editor of your newspaper appriciates my ideas and hopefully agrees with them as well. Thank You!",10
398,"Dear Newspaper, I think that computers have a good effect on people. They have a lot of information give @CAPS2 quicker and increase peoples social ability. Although most people I know are always on the computer I do not believe it's a waste of time. Having a computer is good when you need to do research or write a paper because it allows you to type your ideas if you have messy handwriting. It also provides a lot of information that's right at home instead of having to go to the library and check out multiple books. computers are a good information sources that help you learn about all different kinds of topics. Computers can do all sorts of things like telling you about up-coming events and the latest @CAPS2. At home I know I can never find the right @CAPS2 channel so i just look it yp on the internet. Its also really easy, you just type in what you want to look for in a search engine like @CAPS1 and it will bring you to a group of websites on your topic. Computers quickly change the information as soon as it comes out, making t fresh @CAPS2. I also think that computers benefit the younger age because it allows them to meet new people and stay in touch with family and friends. Websites like @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and @CAPS5 are good I think in moderation. The internet can be a very dangerous place but can also allow silent communication between friends. All my friends are on @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 all the time we can talk to each other all at once, while sharing pictures and videos. It really keeps us occupied and allows us to spend time with people even if they're not really there. In conclusion, I think the computer is a great benefit to everyone by giving us information quick @CAPS2, and by allowing us to stay in touch with friends and family. The computer has modernized so much and will continue to help people out. even if that means spending some time inside or even an hour or so. Over all I think computers are great to have.",9
399,"Dear local Newspaper, The other day I was reading one of your newspaper and I saw the area were you wrote about people not like to use the computer. Well I agree a little because people have to learn how to tip like me I use the computer and I tip really fast, my mom, dad and two brothers use the computer as well. People use the computer for a lot of things like doing homework or playing game or if they have free time just to look up stuff to learn about. Most people use it to make a liveing. They use it to make there on bissness at home. An yes I agree about what people think about computers like its not a bad thing if you dont like computers, I think its a good ideas for people not to use computers cause it can save a lot of money you can have over @NUM1 by not using computers. People get off your computer go out side play soccer, football do somthing. An dont just stay on the computer if your @NUM2 get a job make money. Hang out withe friends some of you are computer geeks and play some dragon games when you can be out side find new friends, you should only have @NUM3 hours to play on the computer like really do somthing with your life.

400,"Dear Local newspaper, I think that the computers are bad. @CAPS8 one reason you get not a lot of exersise, two now they have vurtal planting of flowers and other plantes and tree's when you should be planting a real garden. My thrid a final idea is when you are online you are being lazy. Not a lot of exersise because you can play solitar on the computer when it is so you can go swimming or ride a bike or even go play tag with your friends and or your family. @CAPS8 example lets say you have the choice of a new computer and use it @CAPS8 the day or go to the park and run. chase your little brother or sister and or your cusions even, wich one would you chose? @CAPS1 is this virtual planting? I was talking to my aunt and she was watching this five year old and she asked ""@CAPS1 are you doing?"" The five year old was on @CAPS2 on @CAPS3 on her mothers accont. Now when I heard that I said to myself ""This new technology is taking everything to virutral."" I think that if you want to go plant virtural flowers you should go outside and plant some roses, or even a apple tree. When I look outside I do not see as much flowers as when I was younger. Now are you going to plant virtural flowers or reel flowers? When you are online and looking to see @CAPS1 @CAPS5 has, you are bring a lazy person. You want get us take your family or even your friends and say ""@CAPS4 do you want to go to @CAPS5 with me?"" @CAPS6 @CAPS1 you do is sit on your butox and go online. To tell you the truth I do it but when I am done I go to the store to see the clothes and to try them on.I hate it when people say ""@CAPS7 I cant I am online shopping."" @CAPS8 one you are taking someones job away by the virtual register that could be someone lossing their job. In this ecomincy that could be very hard on a person @CAPS6 job @CAPS6 money if they own a house they have to pay the bills and morage so if they do not have the money they just lost these house. Just because you want to go online shopping maybe because it is easier, but still think next time @CAPS1 if you were that person? How would you feel? So now you know my side of this story. @CAPS1 is your side the lazy, virtural planting and online person or the one who will get up and go outside and just go do it?",9
401,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers help people in many ways such as: helping scientist to gain information that will help mankind live a long life by finding cures for illnesses, allowing people to interact with other people all around the world and help ordinary people like you and I learn new things everyday. Do computers have a positive effect on people? I think they do because they help ordinary everyday people like you and I learn new things every day. If we didn't have computers getting information to every one across the world take a long time, if you mailed it it would take about one to two days if they are in the same country as you, and there is no possible way you could call everyone in the world to tell them you be on the phone for weeks maybe months at a time. Further more computers help scientists find cures and other ways to help mankind live long and prosper. If scientists didn't have computers people would be dying left and right because they didn't have the proper medication or medical attention, we wouldn't have half things we have @DATE1 if we didn't have computers. In conclusion computers make life much easier and getting information people around the the world quicker and more efficient. Without computers in todays society our lives would be much harder than what they already are.",7
402,"Dear local newspaper, I understand that there is an important debate between the people who support computers and people who believe that too much time is being spent on the internet. I can insure you that the internet is affecting peoples physical health, distracting students from their schoolwork, and causing less time to be spent with family and friends. People are spending too much time on computers and it is affecting their physical health. Studies have shown that the average child spends three to four hours on the computer. This is causing people to lack exercise. For example, my friend @PERSON1 is always on @CAPS1 and playing his computer games. He started this trend last year. Since then, he has gained fourty pounds. He now weights @NUM1 lbs and is @NUM2 lbs overweight. It doesn't surprise me because a recent has shown that the leading cause of childhood obesity is children spending too much time on the computer. Do you want america to stay obeise? Computers are distracting students from completing their schoolwork. My friend @PERSON2, a freshman at @ORGANIZATION1, is a victim of distraction by computer. He enjoys @CAPS1 very much, but is on it all the time. This has distracted him from completing and turning in his science homework. Soon, his @NUM3 or @CAPS3+ average dropped drastically to a @NUM4 or @CAPS4-. Soon after, he decided he'@CAPS6 rather go on @CAPS1 then study for tests and quizes. His final grade for the trimester was soon a @NUM5 or a @CAPS6. Do you want to end up like @PERSON2 and receive a horifically low grade in a class that you are very capable of passing? Well studies has became more technologically advanced, our students average grades have been slowly decreasing. Unless we want this trend to continue, we must limit the time our students spend on the computer. Computers are causing children to lose quality time to spend with family and friends. Children need to spend time with their families. They are the people who support children through hard times and comfort them when they are sad. I have a very close relationship with my parents. They are always there for me whenever I reed them. This allows me to maintain my mental health. For example, when I was six, there was a child named @PERSON3 who would always bully me. Whenever I took mental abuse from him, my parents were always there to comfort me. What I am getting at is that children need a healthy relationship with their parents to maintain peace of mind. Although, if children are always on computers, they are not able to build a healthy relationship with their family. The same goes for friends. They are people you can always talk to, but if you are always on the computing then they cannot be there for you. If children do not stop using computers so frequently they will be risking there mental health. Do you want america to remain the most obeise country in the world? Do you want our children's academic performance to plumet? Do you want students to miss out on quality time with their friends and family? Then we must limit the amount of time people spend on computers before its effects on america are too drastic.",10
403,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 have been many discussions floating around about the new technology of out society. Most of them, about computors. Some people say it is making our society more connected. Sure, I agree with that statement, but @CAPS1 are serious negative effects on; humanbeings with these computrrs. Addiction is found to be rising everywhere, along with danger with the internet brings. Many people have even lost their health to it! The list goes on and on. So do you think computors are really worth it? First of all, youth andeven adults become addicted to it. The new things such as @CAPS2, @CAPS3 twitter. Once people start up with these things, they can'r stop! Imagine; your mom finally let's you get a @CAPS2. You're so excited, you stated let's say @NUM1.m. you're so into it you ook up at the clock and it says one o'clock in the morning! You've been on for six hours! How did the time fly? Your getting addicted. You realize you're starting to do that every day. Your grades are failing, you haven't done any homework for the past month, and flunked all your tests. You see what computors can do to people? Time to dig a little bit deeper. Then, more trouble comes. Many teens and even some adults have died because of their computor! They go on to a communication website and meet unknown people. They can lie about their age, life and everything. sooner or later they willingly give their mystery person their name and address. Not a terrific idea. Before they know it, a killer could be knocking at their door. I would say @PERCENT1 of people who give strangers their address get into alot of deep trouble. People have died, been assaulted or have been mentally injured. It's not fun being cornered like that. Too many people have gone through this. No more pain should go around. Last but not least, people suffer from loss of health because of it. People never get to go outside or exsersize. All they do is sit infront of their computors and play games and send emails. People can also suffer from obecety. They never do anything but eat and play with their computor. Is that really a life to live? Doing nothing your whole life? Maybe losing all you energy over time, so all you can do is sleep? You could probably die young because of that. Get active and get exersize. I'm no saying ""@CAPS5 ever get on your computor again!"" I'm saying, don't sit like a cuch potatoe! Do you see all the problems computors can cause people to have? They're terrible! loss of health, addiction and even pain and death. Get people to stop spending time on their computor so much. Even just writing about it in the paper can really encourage people! Help stop the addiction; stop the pain!",10
404,"@CAPS2 I think of a computer I think of a piece of high tech technology with trillions of websites on every subject. But, just because these are made for a good reason doesn't mean the effort they have on people is go. Most people who have computers are helpful"" and @CAPS1 example of ""@NUM1"" century technology"" but are they right? My main question here is are them computer and are these computers for good as the look? Being a teenager I know and a computers can do chatting online, listening to music, watching t.v. shows are all great examples of what sucks you into the internet universe. I spoke to local citizen @PERSON1, @NUM2, and asked her point of view on computers. She says,""@CAPS2 I was a child we never had any technology just sticks and stone. We never had to worry about not getting enough exercise because all we would do is pay outside,""kids today just sit in front of the computer, staring into a screen and moving mouse. That is not my idea of exercise. With computers comes higher obsesity rates. Getting off the computer and playing outside for just @CAPS1 house a day will change your life. Picture this a nice hot @DATE1 day you look outside and see the sun is shining in the sky and theres not a cloud in sight. The sound of birds chirping and bers roaming through your head. And what are you doing? Instead of being out these and enjoying your loosing up pictures of it. Why would you watch a frozen picture @CAPS2 you could watch mother nature in action right before you eyes? Instead of looking at pictures people why dont you take you take some yourself? It's beautiful out there so why don't you experience ot for youself and not have someone else do it for you. Being with my family and friends the most important thing in my life. Some @MONTH1 argue and you can talk to your friend and family on the computer you. Isn't the computer depriving you of something though? For example if a family member is sick with cancer wouldn't you rather be with them every moment you can instead of spending sometime instant messaging them on the computer. Theres one thing the computer can't let you do and thats how much you core someone. As you can see computer hour the pro's and there con's but initially I think the con's win. There so much a computer can do but one thing it cant do is make your desicions. So, are computers as good as they look? that is for you to decide. """,9
405,"Do you really to take away all the help the compoter is it helps the elderly by being able to go to stop and show well watching @CAPS1, or let teens go to school well having breakfast, or even let a man plan his honeymoon well playing poker with his ""boys"".

It @MONTH1 be very hard to go shopping for their own asentionals like food or close. But with the computer they could in last minutes. Without having to leave the room. And in past years I, myself have bought food from stop and shop online it's quite and efective. All from the comfort of your home. Well if you like being comfertable and work to go to school there's another reason you need a computer are being off do online so you could be in you feety pajamas and go to class, because you dont have to leave your room.

406,"Dear reader, @CAPS1 you know that the obesity rate in the @LOCATION1 has grown @PERCENT1 since technology became more advanced? Some say that computers are harmless and have a positive effect on people, where as others say that they have a negative effect on us I for one believe that computers do not benefit anyone. They prevent family time, distract people from other activities, and cause people to get less exercise. To begin, with computers around, families just don't have the same connection they used to. Computers have a large role in most peoples lives, and if there are people in your way of one, such as family members, then a fight breaks out, useally between sbilings. Computers always leave marks on families because not only do they cause fights, but they are unreliable. Information and important papers can get lost easily on a computer and cause you to miss out on the fun things trying to find it. One time I typed an essay on my computer, I saved it, I closed it, and went on my day. The next day I go to print it not its gone I had to type the whole thing again! As you can tell, computers just cause problems and prevent families from having fun. In addition, a computer just prevents people from doing other activities. I have been on the computer inumerable times. When I was supposed to be feeding the animals, cleaning my room paracticing my flute, and each time I end up regreting it. Also, I know many kids that would rather play on the computer thatn go outside and play be cause it is ""too hot"". If kids find any little flow, they will make it an excuse to just play on the computer. Computers are just preventing people from enjoying other activities. To conclude my reasons, computers are just plain unhealthy. If you think about it, computers are like cigarettes, unhealthy and addicting. The prevent people from exercising and staying healthy. @CAPS1 you know that almost @PERCENT2 of the growing obesity in @LOCATION2 is due to playing on the computer? Most people sit home all day, on their computers, only lifting a finger to type or click the mouse. This can be dangerous to people it can cause blood dots and heart attacks. @PERCENT3 of deaths per day are due to obesity. If you can't tell, computers can be hazerdous to people's health. To sum things up, computers are no good to the human race. The cause fights within families, less participation in activities, and contribut to the most dangerous thing, obesity. Computers just make life worse for you and me in the long run. Think, would you rather become overweight and play on the computer liek the people who think it is good for you, or would you rather join me and the others who are healthy?",10
407,"Dear Newspaper, I think computers have a positive effect on people. I say this because I play on computers all day. One reason is because i now have awesome hand-eye cordination. For example on my computer if im about to die in a game, I just grab the keyboard and dont look. If that that doesnt make sense than me and my friends playgames with food where you put a cheese - it on the table and whoever grabs it. And i always get it. Another reason is that I can talk to my frinds online. This is good because then i don't have to make the phone bill more expensive. Also, I can help them with their homework online without having to be next to them. And the last reason I have to share is you can get maps online so you know how to get to places you dont know. That can help everyone because its a lot easier to get a map with directions then trying to decode an atlas or a map of the state. I know that you can also get pictures of school projects too. That is helpful because it will help you grade go up. These are the reasons that I think you should consider looking at before you say that computers are a waste of time and people spend too much time on them.",7

Phones help people stay connected through voice, but computers help people actually see and hear each other. @PERCENT1 of people use a progarm called skype which allows them to video chat with friends and family. Sometimes familys don'@CAPS1 own a webcam so instead the can use email to stay connected. You can send pictures through email and chat or just send someone a message to tell them your doing fine and ask how they are doing. Seven out of ten homes have parents leaving earlier than @NUM1. This means that they either dont have enough time to watch the news and weather or they dont want to disturb the other sleeping family members with the @CAPS1.V on. So instead of watching the @ORGANIZATION1 they can go on the computer and see the weather forecast and news. They can also see if there were any car crashes or other problems on the route they would take to work. This also helps when familys are going on trips. They can look at the weather forecast and decide what they need to bring with them. Almost @PERCENT2 of students use the @CAPS2 to do reasearch. They find information needed to do homework and projects. Most of the time school books do not have enough of the information. Needed to do assignments. Therefore, the computer is an excellent source to get more. Also, using @CAPS2 information helps kids be creative using different information than a text book offers also shows diversity in assignments. When students have different information not only does that one student learn but if they present it to the class the whole class learns something new. That is why I think computers are positively effective. They help familys and friends stay connected, they show people news and weather forecasts and they also help students get reasearch for homework assignments. I hope you greatly consider why I think they are a positive affect on people.",9
409,"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION3 has possesion of a computer, says @ORGANIZATION1. Intelligent people know that you need a computer. How could someone run a buisness without a computer, for example when they need to type or create an important logo online. Some people news are all from the interent, I'm sure of people wouldn't of heard about @ORGANIZATION4's earthquake without it. Another example is a lot of people can only communicate through email, or facebook, aim, etc. Maybe when someones out in @LOCATION4, they can't call so they email. Computers should not be banned! It's absolutley rediculous that someone would come up with such a horific idea. I mean a journalist like you should know this is a horrible ideal. How would you be able to finalize your papers to the news paper without a machine to type on? Are you going to hand write it on to the paper? Or how is someone's job to be a book keeper and hand write people's money, how's there job going to turn out? @PERSON1 a @NUM1 year old mom that has one child and a housband in @LOCATION4 hardly have a chance to communicate. Though when they do it's through email. That's it if she didn't have his email she'd never be able to know how he's doing if he's alright, and same with him. How could you possibly ban this. By banning computers you can make these people's lives more depressing and horrible then it already is know @CAPS1 away the internet from people can do extrem damage to buisnesses. Some buisnesses get all these ads from the internet. Sites like @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, @ORGANIZATION3. What do you think will happen to the owners of those sights. Just we find after all the work they put into those sites. About @PERCENT2 of people buy almost half of there item that they give for gifts or clothes right from the inetrrent. So how could you take this away from them? This no computer ban is a bunch of bolonga! So what are you waiting for @CAPS2? Say no to this ban immidiatly. We most certainly should have computers! Intelligent people know that this idea is whacko. I hope you understand what I'm saying from this piece and make the right decision.",8
410,"Dear, @LOCATION1 hour I am writing to you @DATE1 because I heard that people are writing to you about what they think aboute the effects computers have on people. I understand that computer can have positive and negative effects on people. I think computers have a negative effect on people. I think this because our generation spends way to much time in front of screens. Sure it @MONTH1 in prove hand eye coordination but it also give people an excuse to be lazy, and not get enough excersise which everyone needs. My secong reason is danger because there are all sorts of websites were kids can talk to strangers, they will never know who the person really is. For all they know it could be someone who wants to kidnap you because you believe they are someone they say they are. Sure they seem like a good person no one is really who they say they are and parents can't control what there kids do on there computers. My last reason is some kids might put inapropriete pictures on the internet, they think they can always delete them. But once some think is on the internet it never goes away. So you @MONTH1 think the computers help people, I beg to differ it's an excuse for people to be lazy and get no excersize. So in conclusion please take the time to think about what I have said and agree with me.",7
411,"Dear The @CAPS1, Technology is the most advance thing in these days such as computers. People who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people, which I think its true. They give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, allow people to talk online with other poeple, and teachs hand-eye coordination. In my opinion, I believe that computers have an good effect on people. Many people would agree and think the same. How would people learn information about people and other places? The computer would help you out alot because it teaches you alot of information about places and people. Thats one reason why computer have on effect on people because they find out a whole lot of information, rather than going to a library and reading books. Also, too find out info. its not going to be that hard. For example the website that will help is @CAPS2.com. Its shows a lot of info about a person a places. Another reason why the computer has a positive effect on people is because it could allow people to talk online with other people. of course people would like to communicate with others online, cause it is better. Its better because you could do great things online such as, make an avatar, if you have myspace create a page and more. People chatting online would intrest other people to go online and start chatting. Computers teach hand-eye coordination which is very helpful in the world. It causes an positive effect on people who works with them and people who works like in offices and other places. Having Hand-eye coordination would help you with your typing and also will give the effects companys have on . Everyone who computer has a little hand-eye coordination. Well wouldn't you think computers has an positive effect on people. It does because it gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, allow people to talk online with, other people, and teachs hand-eye coordination. I truly believe that computers benefits society in many ways. Also it has an affect on people. So wouldn't you agree with me and other people who thinks computers has a effect on people.",9
412,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 has come to my concern that people are dissag reeing on whether or not computers have a positive effect on people. Well, my opinion is that computers are very useful for people. @CAPS1 gives us a chance to socialize, learn about places, and even have online colleges tutoring! Please let me explain my ideas @CAPS2 you have friends that don't live close to you? Well, @CAPS3 so online chats like @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 chatting can help you reconnect with you friends. You friends don't even have to live faraway to chat with online. @CAPS1 could be a friend from schol that you want to have a discussion with. Online chatting is as great opportunity for people who want to make friends. Imagine, your a at home mom trying to take care of you family. There's no time for an education unline schools can save this problem you can earn a degree online and have to worry about having to go to school everyday. Don't have the money for education? no problems thats is for get unline tutoring are likely to get there great up by isnt @CAPS1 amazing? and, its free! There are so many places in the world with history history book. All you have to @CAPS2 is go on a search engine type in any faraway place and boom! thousands of facts in just the click of a mouse. @CAPS1's amazing isn't @CAPS1 why search through a history book for hours when all you really need to @CAPS2 is type in anthing on google and get instant knowledge. Faster and easier @CAPS1 is. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers have a positive effect on people in various ways. I hope my opinion have helped you realize that computers only benefit people.",8
413,"Dear Readers, A gaining concern in @LOCATION1 today is the problem on computer. Do they benefit society you people advantage for doing through like @CAPS1, @CAPS2 games.com, or @LOCATION2.. I am against the over use of comnutees. It takes away time from your family, and friends you get less exercise leading into the problem or obesity, and you enjoy without nature @CAPS3 read the rest of this paper to find out I am against this argument. Besides your family your friends and you outside family we the more important people in your life. with out them its a really lonley life for you. Family and friends you to who you ever today you of your family and friends mistakes as @CAPS6 as you can. I remember a time when even family me. I had no friends and for two two yours of a @CAPS4 you can with family and friends online but you @CAPS5 you do is just and do nothing. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS5 people in the @LOCATION3 @CAPS6 things are not going to get better sitting around at a computer listening to music, or watching video.

I hope this letter has helped some people see go on your computer but not to much.",8
414,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that there has lately been of controversy as to whether computers are benign of malovelent. I strongly support the position that computers are sabotaging our experience on @LOCATION2. First with computers around we never get enough exercise to with our @CAPS2. Furthermore, nature might never be enjoyed as much as @CAPS1 should be while computers still infest humans with their pestilance. Finally, with computers disease of distraction being encouraged among students, we will never be able to reach our academic potential. The only place where computers belong is the junu yard. In our new era of computers, exercising is slipping away slowly live the in an hour glass. @CAPS1 is an ominous fact that ever since the flood of computers throughout @LOCATION1 our childhood obesity rate has each year. I can still remember the good old days in second grade when I had friends over and the first thing we would do was around our neighborhood, but now a-days the only thing they seem interested in is playing videogames on the computer. Computers not only affect what we do while with friends, but also while we are alone. If someone is home alone and in one room is a set of weights and in the other rom is a computer, statistics show that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 teenagers would choose to go to the computer. Can't you see how computers are like the devil on our shoulder? Nature was meant to be experienced in person. Not from glance out the window while on the loading screen of a computer. Mostly once quoted that ""Computers are at the human love of nature and eventually there will be nothings left to collode. ""I have observed that every year that there are less and less people making their dog in. Is there really any other excuse for this other than the or computers. While computers are harmful in many ways, the leader or these are how they away at one academic potential. I understand tha the internet has many sources of useful information, but through a thorough survey of @PERSON1, I have found out that less than @PERCENT1 of all students use the computer as a source of information. If computers continue to vacate time that should be used for studying, than @LOCATION1's @ORGANIZATION2 will steadily descend down a path of darkness, and our future generations. In a study of @NUM3 students who studied and @NUM3 students who played on the computer, all or the students who studied scored higher than those who played on the computer, even though they studied math while the test was on science. Computers will continue to be the of our lives unless we put a wall in its path immediately.",10
415,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you know studies show @PERCENT1 of population doesn't get enough exercise? Also, that same @PERCENT1 wastes most of their time and money? The colprate for this are computers. Computers are a complete waste, not only are they unnecesary costs, they give out too much information. The even prevent users from getting exercise by doing something useful. I firmly believe computers have a bad and terrible effect on people. Computers are allways asking and giving out too much information. They ask for names, ages, and even street adresses. Believe it or not, most people will even give the computers this information. By doing this it is very unsafe and something you wouldn't want a computer to have. Out of all the deaths in our coutry, @PERCENT2on them are from murderers stalking computer users and hunting them down. This is not something I would want to happen to me or close friends. Als, people can easily lie. @NUM1 year old men can lie and say they are @NUM2 year old girls. They could trick you into being their friend this way too. So, why bother with a computer when it could be this dangerous? Some people think actually help you with things like hand-eye cordination. but, do you actually think computers can help? The whole time, you are just sitting and starring at a screen as it changes when you click your hand. this is not what you want to be doing. Obeasity is a very large issue for @CAPS2 and computers are not adding to resolve the issue. A local nutritionist told me,"" if everyone would not use computers and @NUM3 of this country would be obeas."" @CAPS3 of being lazy on the computer you could go on outside feeling the fresh air. Not only sit preventing exercise, it wastes alot of time. Websites on the computer try to be addicting so they can get alot of views, in fact there call addicting @LOCATION1. Whily your being glued to @CAPS4 websites your wasting lots of time that could be use for oppertunities like family game night or even homework. You can probly realize computers will obviously not help you. Computors have a fairly expensive lost that comes with it. They are not a cheap item and after you buy one you also have to pay for the electricty needed to run it. Just to add on you'll have to spend money on virus protection and office applications. People shouldn't waste so much money on a electronic that will waste your time, exspeciallyin such the many crisis we are all in today. A survey proved @NUM4 to or @NUM5 workers will work to save up computers. That money could be used for family vacations or sport programs, something worth it. unnecassary payments for a computer is not a good decision. Paying loads of money to look at a glowing screen is one of the worst things. I have heard of these computers will waste your time and prevent you from physical activity. Knowing it could potentially lead a murderer to you and give out your private information, now who would want thats I am fully against computors and the effect they have on people and so should you.",10
416,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 would life be like with out computers? They are very important to @CAPS7 society. People use computers and other electronics everyday for their business, communication, or simply inst for leasure. @CAPS3 should be advances in computers because they teach people hand and eye coordination, are people the ability to learn about faraway places using the internet, and even talk on line with people miles away. To begin with, computers can help us develope hand and eye coordination. @CAPS2 is simply done when we type and look at the screen while we are writing a paper for class, responding to an e-mail, or even searching a word on @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON3, biologist that specializes in animal's hand and eye coordination says ""Hand and eye coordination is four in many and is important to the survival. Being able to climb a tree or on prey is strongly and eye coordination."" @CAPS2 is quite obvious that computers will benefit @CAPS7 hand and eye on which is used in @CAPS7. Also, the computers you the ability to learn about people and places far away. Before we had computer the only way you could learn about a place is by. This first of all, is very expensive. Plus, @CAPS2 takes a very long time to get @CAPS3. With the internet @CAPS2 takes only a click of a button and a few seconds to discover the information of a country miles away. But don't ate my word for. @PERSON2, internet expert says ""@CAPS3 are almost @NUM1 billion different websites with useful information at your finger tips with a computer. Plus, the average cost of a continent is @NUM2."" The internet is one of the host features computers have, so lets work to abvance them. Finally, computers allow us to communicate with others.

Major @PERSON1 says ""@CAPS7 computers are one of @CAPS7 most important tool that we use. If a squad heeds are support, soldiers can use laptops to call in missle support from @CAPS8 @CAPS9 air crafts."" Computers are very important advances in communications. I hope that I have given you enough reasons to make advances in computers. I will",9
417,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 do computers really effect people as a whole? It has been brought to my attention that some people believe, the computer has negative effects on our society. I believe that these pieces of technology have a positive outcome on us. They give us the ability to learn about other places around the globe, it allows us to talk to friends and family and they also provide a source of entertainment. Don't you ever wonder what's outside the borders of our country? Well many @CAPS3 do now and then, With computers, we have the oppurtunity to learn about life styles different than our own. Just by surfing the web we can find all sorts of different information that we all crave. For instance, you can find out what types of food are eaten in @LOCATION1 with no hassle. With just click of a button, many different sources appear for easy arress. Wouldn't you like to discover what's out there with a click of a button? Aren't there any relatives of friends that live far away that you wish to speak too? Well, technology has given you an easy way to communicate called the computer. While online, you and just about everyone else can go in a chat room or e-mail/@CAPS4 session, which allows us to talk to one another. Family members can catch up on the latest news, while old friends can share favorite Even I use the computer to keep up with my family because they all live out or state. Don't you wish to stay caught up with friends and family of your own? Has this over happened to you? You plan a nice day outside and then the weather turns for the worst? @PERCENT1 of our population has gone through this problem. If you must stay inside then why most use the computer? Even though you can't go outside there are of games and applications on computers that can pass the time. What better use can there be for our computers besides entertainment? Computers effect our as a whole in a positive light. I believe they give us a strong, positive effect on our lives. They allow us to learn about other places around the globe you can use them to keep up with family and friends, and they can entertain us when we need it. Please take my arguements into consideration when choosing your side of this arguement.",9
418,"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers have a lot of effects on people. They could keep people from getting outside and enjoying the weather, which is a bad thing. Computers maybe good for interacting with people, such as family and friends, but they also maybe bad for our health. Computers have a big effect on people because they keep you from getting up and moving around. They keep you from excersing which could be a health problem. It's worse for children my age and older because all the social networking is keeping us from doing other things that we normally never do. Another effect that computers have on people is interacting with people you don't know or family members by using a webcam. It might be fun to talk to people you don't have a clue about, but you have to be careful because you don't know what's going on to happen after you finish talking to him/her. The lost effect that computers people is doing research. A lot of children have to do research on the computer. Whether it being for a project or for regular homework. This is a big effect because there are a lot of websites on the internet, and it's most likely that you're not going to find all the information that you need, because most of those websites talk about things that don't involve in the subject you're trying to search up. This is also a big affect because you could be sitting at your computer for hours and end up not finding anything. These are all the effects that I think computers have on people and maybe someday we could change them.",8
419,"Dear local news paper, People should use more computer because you learn more about mathematics, you can learn about different country, and you can talk to your friends. @PERCENT1 of people is learning more mathematics on the computer than the teacher teaching them.

420,"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, ""Computers have become great advances in technology. However the way humans are being affected isn't in the most positive manner. It is nessesary for people to limit computer time."" according to world renown psychologist, @PERSON1. The question then is do computers affect humans in a positive or negative way. I firmly believe that this advance in technology isn't the best. Now adays with computers people aren't keeping to a diet and exercising. All they do is sit in front of the computer screen. By not getting the exercise every person needs people become overweight and obese which could also lead to other health problems. Could you picture yourself over the years slowing gaining pounds because you made the mistake of not exercising, but dillydallying on the computer? Then computers have also made people lazy. For example one might just send an e-card instead of a birthday card because they didn't ""feel up to"" getting out of the house. If people were training for a particular sport intensly and all of a sudden stopped due to the ""pull"" of their computer all of their previous hard work would be for nothing. The water is rushing by you as one arm goes in and the other out. Your feet are kicking, but slowly your hours of training seem to be disappearing and being replaced by computer time. Due to the effect of computers people aren't even able to enjoy nature. The beautiful trees are growing and the rose bushes are blooming magnificent flowers, however almost no one notices them anymore. Everything outside is lovely but people don't experience it because of this technology. People today aren't even receiving fresh air fromstaying inside all cooped up. According to the @ORGANIZATION1 in every @NUM1 people who have @ORGANIZATION1 will have a more severe case if they don't get the recommended amount of fresh air needed. Since people don't even enjoy nature anymore because they are on computers all day they care for it less as well. I have observed that whenered people are outside they just dispose of their garbage in a horrible manner, and don't pay attention to where it might end up. I can understand the point of view that you can meet and make new friends online, however this in a sense causes one to lessen interaction with friends and family. Smart and well informed people will not spend large somes of time on the computer to stop interaction with others. Some other people though seem to be caught in their own little world on the computer. It is extremly easy for people to lose friendships because of the computer. I know this from personal experience since I too used to spend to much time on it. I had been spending so much time on the computer that one of my friends became fed up with me and wouldn't really talk to me after it. Then also one's family might feel abandoned by a person from the excessive time spent on this technology. There it is time to realize that computers have a bad effect on people. Almost no one receives their daily exercise to keep them healthy. People then also forget about nature and how to enjoy it. Most of all though it clearly affects the relationships between friends and family. Therefore it is time to take action.",11
421,"There have been many advances in technology over the last hundred years, one of which, being the computer. Though, this invention has benefitted humanity greatly, it has also had many negetive effects as well. Three of these neagtive effects are people are spending to much time online and less time execising, interacting with friends and family, and last but not the least, cyber bullying. Recently, many kids, student, and adults of all ages have spent much more time with computers and videogames when they could be spending that time on other outdoor activities such as sports, biking, hiking, etc. Through studies have shown that computers can teach hand-eye coordination, @CAPS1 sure that you could learn that much better by doing some other physical activity. Also, with the of exercise due to technology like computers, many more people have become overweight and the problem can only get worse. Now-a-days people commonly rely on computers for simple things such as news and communication. Since almost everything is available online these days, many people dont find the need to leave there own home anymore. As computers become slowly more entertaining to a individuall, they dont find the need of interactions of friends and family anymore for entertainment. Would you like to have a anti-social son or daughter because I know it wouldn't. This is just another reason that shows how computers have had a negative affect on us.",8
422,"Dear local newspaper, I don't think that computers effect people instead I think it makes them smarter. One example that can support my opinion is that when you researh online you get to understand more stuff. Another example that can support my opinion is that you can chat with people from other contrys. My last example is that you can surch about your absesters if you dont know nothing about them. These examples shows how computers can make you smater. When you reserch online you get to understand. more stuff. For example if you need help with your school work and you dont have no one to help you, you could use the computer and it will help you understand what you need to understand. Maybe you need more information on a topic if you research about it the computer will help you. This is important because computer can make you understand topics you dont know about. My second example is that you can chat with people from other contrys and learn about their habitat. For example while your chating with them they could tell you stuff you dont know about their contry. This is important because you could learn stuff about other contrys. My last examples that you can surch about yoor ansesters if you dont know nothing about them. For example you could find out stuff you did not know about them. This is important because you get to know about you. Tradition more. Like from where they come from how many generations are in your family and more stuff. As a result I think every one should use computers because they help you understand more stuff, learn about other contrys, and learn about your ansesters. I hope I changed your mind about computers.",8

And if you need some pictures on some one you can go to google of @CAPS2. But in the other hand those are some bad thing about computers too, like for example myspace, you can get and horased and made fin of, anf there is a lot of people that are fake on myspace, people can just get some one's elses pics and put them on and say that they are who you see and there can be people that like to cyberbully. You can get in trouble too, if you tell some one you age, name, or even you adress, stranger can come to you house. And if you like you computer alot and you like to download alot of softeare you can get alot of virusis much leads to mesing up you computer. And there is a thing call spyhore wore some one can hack or you computer is already hacked some on might be hocking what you are doing on the computer and it is not good because you can use it is not good because you can use it for bad thing like hocking things, like computers, sites, sometimes, and much more. And it is a must of money because it can set messed up and just for one computer is like. But it is usefull for life beacuse you can get stuff and order stuff you can buy thing on the internet like household apliences, and thing you can have fun with for example a toy, if you are looking for a car toy and no one has it that lives around you, you can just go on the computer and look it up.",8
424,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, People all around the world use computers everyday. I believe that computers have very good effects on people all over the world. One positive affect that computers have very good effects on people all over the world. One positive affect that computers have on people is that we are able to learn a great deal of information of topics that we never knew existed. Another good effect is that people are able to interact with other people around the world. The lost good effects that computers have an people in that we are able to research objects that we @MONTH1 purchase in the near futer and buy it online. People, everyday use computers to learn about topics that they know existed. To this day, I have had multiple projects due for history, @CAPS3, and almost every other subject. If I did not have acess to a computer I would not have done nearly do well as I have. I am working on a project in history class about @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6, The I chase was @PERSON1, or great secretary of stud and military leader, there aren't many books in our library about him so I go straight to the computer. The computer always have information on any topic or object last week I look a survey, and over @PERCENT1 of all the students in my school use the computer and internet for either there homework or projects. That is one reason how computers have a positive affect on people and children. Using the computer can also help you interact with friends, family or even people you don't knew and would like to meet. Almost @PERCENT2 of all adults over the age of @NUM1 have @CAPS7 or @CAPS8. On those webistes you are able, in meet new people and talk to your friends. I have a @CAPS8 account and it is good people meet new people and become more with their lives. I have more provids on my account and I can talk to them all the them. The by if for example that are still while we in the @LOCATION1. My mother keeps with our relatives in @LOCATION2 by @CAPS8 on its tiny are still with us. That is my secon computer people everyday. Computers are for buy in the . Using this you are not money because you can as much time and the object. Last your for my birthday I on that as in @CAPS9 car and I got over @NUM2 million hits. I reasearched the cars and round the one the suited me and was not less expensive. I believe that researching objects can save you time and many. For example, if you go to a store and the store does not have the item then you just lost aproxiounetely @NUM3 hours. You @MONTH1 also waste money becasue if you just search the object you want, then you are able to see where the lowest price is. The computer can save a tirp to a store by just ordering your item right from the internet. My mother always busy my shoes and her paper online because she does not have the time to go shop for one. That is my last reason why computers really do have a positive affect on people. Now you how why computers have a positive affect on peoples lives everyday. Computers help students leanr about topics for school, they help people interact with other people and save you time and money while shopping for items. I strongly suggest that you agree with my arguement, computers affect and help everyone with their lives. P.S. strongly recomend you agree with my argument.",11

It costs an insane amount of worry to make international calls to them, so I don't. I connect with my family through instant message, e-mail and @CAPS1. (A social networking site) I can post pictures to @CAPS1 as can my relatives, and I can cousins grow up. All @NUM1 of them. My cousin @PERSON1 and I talk almost every day through the computer. We're tighter than spandex on a guy and yet, we live hundreds of miles apart. that allow my family to connect. my essays have you type up? do you recieve via e-mail, @PERSON2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4? I'm you rely on computers to get information, just as much as you need to create spreadsheets and This was certainly The itself @CAPS5 you imagine if you had to draw each these up? Four something for every greater take give you some idea as to how important computers are to society. I know that some people would say that @ORGANIZATION1's aren't important ( agree) but, to you, they must be very important you administer This might you by surprise. My eh? Or maybe a bunch of people do I can see how one would become obese from spending every free moment on the computer. I haven't met one overweight person who isn't aware that they are overweight. Some choose to do something about it, such as myself. Some people are ditching their social for @CAPS6. (@CAPS7 @CAPS8 Online @CAPS9 @CAPS10) @CAPS11? not really, @CAPS12? Definitely. People usually know when they aren't exercising or not having a social life. They just choose to not do anything about it, and this is not society's fault, so why are we being blaimed for it? You don't know? Neither do I. In conclusion, computers are wonderful tools for those who utalize them appropriately.",8

Finally, I now i that they should stop making computer to people to explor the nature with there fimaly.",4
427,"Dear Newspaper, I don't think that we spend to much time on them because we go to school work we go outside and we and not everbody has them. This is why I think that we don't spend that much time on the computers. Everybody mostly gos to school or work witch means less time on the computer and as they drive to school or work they will be able to look at the nature. And also most kids and adualts go to school or work for at least eaght hours a day. witch keeps them of the computer for quight a while. Also from my exsperence what I do and most my friends do is go on the computer when we get home checck our facebook, myspace, youtube, and aim acconts the get off and go hangout after we hang out I will go on the computor for like @NUM1 hours a day thats all. That is one reson why I think that we don't use computers that much. Most people go outside once a day or more @CAPS1 that I go outside everday to bmx or go to an @CAPS2 skatepark. Also many people cannat afrod computers there for they never go on computer. So they go outside and sit on the streets and do nothing also many people love to go outside and just have fun out there and not be on the computer @NUM2, and also many people would probly get bored of sitting on the computer all day I no I would be very bored @CAPS3 I was on the computer all day. So I would go outside. That is my second reason why I think we don't use computers that much. Lastly not everbody has one. The reson not everbody has them is because not everbody got the money to be a computers even @CAPS3 they by a computer they might not be able to pay the internet bill witch means this will keep them of the computer because its no fun without the internet. Also some people don't have them because they don't want one. someoder people do not want the new technolgy because there use to having what they had when the were a kid growing up also @CAPS4 might be to complecated for some of the old people to use a computer. That is my thrid reson I think we do not use computers that much. To wrap @CAPS4 all up I think we don't use computers that much because of school and work being outside and lastly not everbody has them to be used. That is why we are not using computers to much.",9
428,"Dear: Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that people are using computers for positive effects. The technology of the computer gives people the ability to learn, talk to friends, and also look online for other important reasons. The technology of a computer helps people with hand-eye coordination. I think computers are a positive effect to benefit society. People all around the world use computers for different reason @CAPS1 is a great thing that we have technology like computers now in days. My first reason is about using the computer for the ability to learn. Sometimes students need a computer to help them in a sertend subjet for example: a kid needs help with math there websites that he or she can go on to help them get better with math. Theres website's teachers might give you or also there's websites you can go on like @CAPS2 brain, master math, and other cool, fun, but still educational website for kids to learn. I think computers can be very helpful for student, kids that need a little more help then others. So that was my first reason so lets go to the next reason. My next reason is that teenagers have the ability to talk to friends the internet. I think thats better then having you kids out doing drugs and drink and get them in trouble. Its a great idea to have a computer because then your kids can have fun talking to there friends online teens can run up there phone bills. And teen dont only have to talk to friends online they can talk to family members that dont live near by. Teens these day love using computers so parent should say no to hanging out with bad people and say yes to talking ever the computer. My third reason is that kids, teens, grown ups can go online for other importants reasons. For example familys might want to go on trips and they want to go online to see were they want to go and stay at. Also familys might be looking for fansie restaurants to eat for a special ocation. So keep in mind computers always come in handy. For prepases like kids need to get better in a subject teens want to talk with friends online, or family vacations. Well thats all I had to say I just want to say one more thing keep this in mind!",9
429,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I believe people shouldn't spend their time on computers all the time. Most people that spend all day on the @CAPS4 develope poor social skills, and health problems. Some supporters that like that computers help develope hand-eye coordination, and help people learn about the people and places around the world. Social skills are a necessity to life. People need to know how to interact with others so they can function in susiety. When gamers or computer addicts don't socially involve themselves they become afraid or shy. to be able to have many different kind of jobs its crutial to know how to do buisness with people by talking and being social. Lazy people that just want to stay inside all day and video chat or playing video games online can develope health problems from not being physically active. A friend of mine became diabetic because he would eat lots of junk and not go outsided to burn off all the bad sugars in his body. People @MONTH1 develope diseases were they are dependent on people to take cure of them because they are too afraid of people outside their games world. People can lose contact with the outside world. They might forget where they are or if something happened right down the street they wouldn't know. Computers can have many up-sides to the like learning and hand-eye coordination but there are more down-sides to them than up. If people are on the computer all the time learning about distant places they would spend all their time going online to see it insted of acctually going. I support my idea's of computers harming people if they spend all day @NUM1 on the because of social problems later on in life. Health risks from not being active, and loss to the outside world. These are my reason's why I stand firmly about my opinion.",8
430,"Dear Local Newspaper, Some people think that using computers benefit the society and some don't. My position on this matter is that it doesn't benefit the society. Mt theories are they use the computer a lot and they don't get out their houses and don't exersice and they don't know how good it feels to go outside just to enjoy it and they also don't know how their family and friend are doing because they haven't talk to them them in a because are computer. Some people don't and exercise because of computers. People are stock on the computer just won't have to exercise just recently my weight and be spent all told him that and so he now had free time and be started to work out and he got fit. But for his birthday she bought him a laptop now he doesn't go to the @CAPS1 to workout he goes to on his laptop and now he's getting big again. You see when he had a somputer he was they took it away he lost weight but when he got back in the all back, and it all because of the computer. Being outside good its in the @DATE1 you can camp or swim in pools in which you can but you have a computer. You stay on your laptops and don't get time to go out because you've wasted time on the computer. You can do the but you don't don't get the some you do when you do go outside. The computers you affect your go on the computer to talk or family and friends but it doesn't feel the same as seeing them in person. According to student studies @PERCENT1 of people who spend most time on computer than seeing family are like to have postamatic stress. What is that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people are stress out from not talking or seeing family and friends due to spend too much time on computers. Yes we know @CAPS2 and playing are fun but it costs out time you could be spending with friends and family or @CAPS2 outside and exercising to be healthy and fit. So what are you @CAPS2 to do sit there on the computer or go and enjoy life!?",8
431,"Dear @PERSON1, @CAPS1 kids looking down on their hand just to see what they are doing. @CAPS1 curious people wanting to know about faraway place but can’t. @CAPS1 relatives not being able to talk to their nieces, nephews or grandchildren. Computer fix that by improving hand-eye coordination, educational purposes and allow a degree of communication. I believe computer are a huge technical advancement in our time. First, computers help with hand-eye coordination. Sports @CAPS2 said that kids do well in sports due to fast reflexes from hand-eye coordination. Also, parents noticed their kids are multi-tasking more easily. Experts also say that kids are writting faster thanks to hand-eye coordination. Next, computers are a huge part of education. There are many courses that people can take online. Dr. @DR1, a social studies @CAPS3, says that its easier to teach class with online activities. Also, in @CAPS3’s magazine, a poll shows that that out of @NUM1 students @NUM2 would rather study online than from a book. Computers can really make school more interesting. Finally, computers have a degree of communication. Kids can also contact their relative from around the world. Also, advertisements are posted on the web. Buisness men say that @PERCENT1 of their advertisments is online. Phycologys say that kids can build their communication skills online. Now @CAPS1 kids using effective ways to study,playing sports, and talk to their relatives whenever they want. Computers improve hand-eye coordination, help educate, and improve communications. So @PERSON1 post my artical to explain how useful computers can be!",8
432,"Computers are a fairly new invention. Years ago, computers were so big it took a whole room to store one, but now, with advances in tecnology, laptops centimeters than, and touch screen @CAPS1 have become regular sights in homes all across @LOCATION1, but is this a good thing? Computers can help people learn new things, teach hand-eye coordination, and can introduce to a bunch of great new people. Therefore, I would say, yes computers are a good thing, and every citizen should have one. Years' ago, if a student needed to look up facts for a project, he/she would have had to go all the way to library to get that information, and the back they need could already be checked at! Now what? Because of @ORGANIZATION1, another search engines, info is available with the click of a button, therefore this problem would never have come up. Futhermore, @ORGANIZATION1 also has pictures that are free an easily asseside. But that's not all, all the latest news and celebrity gossip is available as well! You can quickly, easily, and conviently find out about important events like the earthquake in @LOCATION2 and you could donate money to help the cause as well. More information can only be a good thing, and that's not all a computer Have you ever wanted to be good at sports like tennis, or baseball, but never had enough hand eye coordination? Well studys show that @PERCENT1 of people who played online games for at least an hour a week got better hand-eye coordination in @NUM1 weeks! Games like @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and similar precludes challenge the mind and body to work together and make the body stronger, faster and more which would help to do everyday like driving cars. Furthermore, most people don't play sports because they good of them, but with better reflexes and a quick mind, they could improve at these sports, and help to solve @LOCATION1's obesity problem. This could only be a good thing. Computer's are the key to the char of wellness, all @LOCATION1 must do is provide a hand to learn this key. One of the main concerns for computer critics is that people will spend too much time on the computer, and not enough time interacting with family and friends, however, on the contrary, I feel that computers @CAPS4 the bands between people say someone had a reletive or friend who lived very far away from then, so they never got to see then. Well with a computer, this person could email, I. My or even video chat this person anytime they wanted! Aus, computers allow people to not only talk to known friends, computers also allow users to meet new people and possibly make new friends! Furthermore, computers can help to boost the confidence and self-esteam of shy people. I know that before I started using a computer I was quiet and always scared of what other people would think but taking online helped to boost my confidence, and I'm taking more and making new friends outside of the computer as well as inside. More confident, friends and social people are what say country would want for citizens. Therefore, computers ant the awful burden to society that critics have made then out to be, in bet, computers are great for many things, including learning new things, better hand-eye coordination, and meeting new people, therefore we should encourage everyone to buy a computer today!",10
433,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1 some people @MONTH1 be concerned that people are spending too much time on the computer, many experts can argue that computers are a wonderful things. Did you know that more than @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 own a computer? That is because computers help you gain skills that are used multiple times throughout your life. Also, with a computer, people can gain instant access to anything they need. One last reason is that many people use computers to keep in touch with friends or relatives, perhaps those who live far away. It @MONTH1 seem that a computer plays a big role in one's life, and truth is, they @CAPS6 continue helping people build foundations for future careers and goals. Many times, when you look for a job, you have to fill out a resume. A resume shows the business owner @CAPS5 skills you have and @CAPS5 skills you're willing to put forward to help the company. Nowadays, more and more companies have started using computers and knowing how to use one is a basic necessity. ""I'm on a computer every day at work filing claims, doing paperwork, and helping customers,"" says @PERSON1, an insurance under writer in @LOCATION1. If she did not have good typing skills, great hand-eye coordination, and excellent word processing skills, she wouldn't have been hired for the job. The young generation is getting an early start on building that foundation that they @CAPS6 use throughout their futures it @CAPS6 sure come in handy someday. Say you're a reporter for channel @NUM1 @ORGANIZATION1. There's a breaking story that your audience needs to hear as soon as possible. You log onto your computer to find instant information on the story. Your twitter feed is exploding with the exciting @ORGANIZATION1 and now you have material to report on for your @ORGANIZATION1 report. The moral is, with a computer people gain instant access to @ORGANIZATION1, whereas, they might have to wait hours for the local @ORGANIZATION1 report, or in this case, they are the reporter looking for. Resident of @LOCATION3, @PERSON2 says ""The @CAPS3 homepage is one of my daily fixes. I check it multiple times a day!"" overall, that goes to show that people all over the world can be aware of the latest happenings on their planet. The last, and possibly most important reason for computers is to keep in touch with people. You can easily sign onto @CAPS4 and talk with your cousin who lives all the way in @LOCATION2. Or the friend that you miss who only lives an hour away. One knows that social networking is a daily stop, and it's an awesome way to keep in contact. @PERCENT2 of the people in the world have some type of instant messenger all their, a recent study showed you just have plans with your friend and can't remember @CAPS5 time to meet. A quick virtual message saying ""@CAPS5 time do you want to go?"" @CAPS6 solve your problem. That is instant communication at its' finest. I hope that you're convinced that computers are after all a great thing. People build everyday life skills, they have fast access to the latest @ORGANIZATION1, and you can keep in touch with people that you don't normally get to talk to. Now, which one of the @PERCENT3 of @CAPS2 who don't own a computer are going out to buy one? In conclusion, computers help people through daily life, and I would sure hope you consider purchasing one.",9
434,"Hortford @CAPS1, I believe that the effects of computers are negative. There are mainly @NUM1 ideas why I think they are negitive. First reason is @CAPS2. The computer effects your @CAPS2 because your sitting on a choir. Stairing at the bright computer screen for @NUM2 to @NUM3 hrs. While you could be outside exercising. Runnig around having a great time with friends and family. Second reason is @CAPS3. The computer effects your @CAPS3 because you sit at your computer playing games or on @CAPS5 or @CAPS6 but your not learning anything. You should be doing homework or you could write on essay. You should be writing or reading everyday. Last reason is recycle. While your on the computer you probly printed @NUM1 or @NUM2 papers and thats a waist of paper. You just killed a tree. Trees and flowers are what give us air and were killing tress for computer paper. Now do you see why the effects of the computer are bad and I hope you agree.",6
435,"Computers are one of the most important forms of technology in society today. There are so many different ways to use them, and they are a major tool for success in @CAPS1, education and engineering. They teach hand-eye coordination, allow people to learn about most anything and can be used for communication between people who live far away. I think computers are a great tool and that they should be more positively recognized for all the good they help people do every day. Computers teach us many things. We learn hand-eye coordination from moving the mouse with our hands and seeing the cursor on the screen move too. Babies can also learn special software about colors and sounds. Interactive games help children of all ages learn and undersatand the things around them. My cousin loved looking at the computer screen when she was a baby. It really helped her to learn about colors and sounds, as it does for many babies. Computers are a very good early learning tool. Without computers, I don't see how I would be able to know so much about places I have been to. Sure books help, but I bet a lot of information found in books was originally on the internet or atleast double checked using the internet. The computer also has more visuals and pictures of what distant places look like. I @MONTH1 never really see the great wall of @LOCATION2, but I can atleast get an idea of what it looks like from photos taken a postedl to a website. The computer can be used for finding nearly any type of information and really helps people understand too! A few years ago, my best friend moved away to a differrent state. I was really sad to see her go, but I felt better that I could email her and send her pictures of what was going on here in @LOCATION1. Through the computer, we have stayed friends and are now able to instant message every night to keep in touch. Friends are not the only people who do this, however, @CAPS1 corperations talk to other corperations over a webcam. A person who couldn't attend a meeting can log on and see what their co-workers are saying, almost as if they were really there. Online communication is a really great tool to use in @CAPS1 and normal life alike. So, computers @MONTH1 have a few miner drawbacks but overall they are a great advancemant in technology and a huge part of our society. They teach important skills, give information about almost anything and provide a quick, easy form of communication to just about anywhere in the world. Overall, computers are a great resource and can help people today in so many ways. I believe that computers have a very positive affect on people in our world today.",9
436,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you know, the @NUM1 century is often referred to @CAPS1 the @CAPS2 of Technology due to the fact that many technological advances have been achieved. One of these such advantages is the computer. These have been disputes over whether the computer benefits society, or damages it. @CAPS1 helpful @CAPS1 the computer @MONTH1 be, it ultimately does not benefit society in the long run. Exessive use of the computer causes health problem, prevents people from enjoying nature and does not promote actual @CAPS3 to @CAPS3 inteaction with others. Many health problems today have been associated with the excessive use of electronics and computers. High blood pressure, obesity and strain on the eyes and hands can somehow be connected to computer. These are problems that @MONTH1 impact ones ability to work and could pose severe health hazards. Obesity and high blood pressre coupled together greatly hightens the risk of heart disease while eye and hand problems @MONTH1 greatly reduce the ability to function in and outside of a home environment. In fact, a recent study shows that @NUM2 out of every @NUM3 excessive computer users suffers some kind of health problem. In conjuction, Computers also prevent many people from going outside and interacting with nature, whether it be playing outside or simply taking a walk. Studies taken by @ORGANIZATION1 show that these simlpe interactions help reduce stress and work wonders for our own health. However, a vast majority of people do not experience this due to the fact that they are constantly distracted by the lure of the computer. In another study, it shows that these inteactions also help improve happiness levels and would result in a much happier person. But, like so many of us we do not go outside to enjoy the simply joys in life. Last, computers do not promote @CAPS3 to @CAPS3 contact. Although many would that computers help people across the globe interact with one another, it does not promote the actual to the human psyche. Studies conducted by varrous laboratories around the world all agree that the human mind craves for person to person contact. The computer cannot provide this contact, therefore the mind of a crucial past of our lifestyle. Due to these computers, society and our own bodies are slowly but surely being damaged in a way that could be irreversable.",10
437,Dear the @ORGANIZATION1 I think that computers are positive to people. I say that because people could use a computer for there colledge work. Also we can use it to find out more about things like @CAPS1. The computer will give us more details about it. The computer can help us with writing if are hands are hurting or your arm is broken you can use it to type. Plus the computer can help us print out pictures because if we don't know how to draw a picture than all we have to do is go on the computer to print out things. We can also use the computer for directions like if we can't afford a gps we can use the computer to print out directions. We can also use the computer to buy things like a car if we can not find the dealership we can go on the computer and buy one and have shiped off to us. So that is why computers are positive to people.,6
438,"Dear @CAPS1, I have recently read from my next door neighbor that the @ORGANIZATION1 wants to know peoples opinion on the advantages of computers. Mark the science specealist says that @PERCENT1 of people think that computers are bad. The other @PERCENT2 think computers are awsome. In my opinion computers are great. First of all, computers help people learn their hand-eye coordination. Computers are future. By typing on the computer all the time you barn that your fingers have a mind of their own, @PERCENT3 of my second grade english class learned how to type. The other @PERCENT4 learned after. My mother learned how to type when she was @NUM1. She is now @NUM2 and just getting hand-eye coordination. By the children learning how to type they will have hand-ey coordinaiton by their teen years. Secondyl, when you go on vacation you can still be at school. By having computers no one any exusests miss school. My friend @PERSON1 lives in @LOCATION1 and come over to she was on the computer for @TIME1. When she went back to school her teacher didn't have to go out of her way to teach her. By having computers people can go anywhere. @PERSON1 traveled across the world and did it! So having computers is a huge advantage when it comes to vacation or even being sick. Lastly, computers have a posative advantage/ outcome on people. By people not having to deal with having writer's cramp because you could type. have you ever gotten a writing cramp? If you have you know that it is very uncomfortible. Doctors have prmen that people will put more on paper when they type, also that getting writer's cramp can cause arthritous in your hand. Everybody gets writer's cramp even pre-k children. The little kids are always coloring. In conclusion, I think that having computers is a very good advantage. By helping with handeye coordination hey help people when they go away on vacations, and computers have a posotive outcome on people. So you see computers aare very helpful. You should like computers too.",9
439,"Dear newspaper, I would like to let you know that, I think computers are a great product to use. People are able to do all thngs with computers. Including checking email or chat with friends. We also are able to see ehat the weather will be like instead of waiting for the @CAPS1 to come on learning about places out of state or in another country, can be activated with the touch of a mouse. Without checking email everyday my mom would be lost and would not know what to do. She makes sure sports and appointments are not cancelled. IF she were not to have email, we would drive all the way to the places and just have to go back. Email saves so much time for everyone. Online chatting is another good way to see your friends, and talk about things. The only bad thing is that your not getting some fresh or at the same time. You can meet so many new people and expand your friendship. Weather needs to be checked all the time by people to make sure the roads wont be bad or to wonder about a baseball game. My dad makes me also get on the computer and go to weatherchannel.com. This is because he us learning for work the next day and does not want it to snow. The good thing about getting the weather online is that if is so quick, when you would have to wait for the @CAPS1 to come on and tell you. It could waste a lot of time. And if the computer is bad, isn't the couch bad too? How about the video tour? yes, the computer will give you one of those for your favorite place. You are now able to go places without the plane. You can go on the computer now research the place you want. This helps on projects, because they are able to get everything they need to know and put it onto a paper. This could also help people decide where to go for a trip. If you want to go to @LOCATION1, then you search it and could find out how much it would cost, or what places to visit while there. The effects that computers have on us, are not bad, you just want to use it more. Yes go on when they get home, but at school they have recess and gym. People don't get fat if they sit on the computer, they get fat depending on what they eat. You should really be tring to fight eating adiction not computer adiction.",9
440,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, The effects computers can have on people can be good, and bad. I happen to think computers are a good help to the society. Having a computer is like having your own little reference to anything. Would you rather go out and by a ton of books, and talk to a lot of people, or just sit at home and find what you need immediately? Everybody now just wants it to be quick and simple. Next, just like before, there are kids with homework. When people have research to do for homework, they go on the computer. So, having a computer isn't such a waste of time. Although kids and people can get distracted, but hopefully they will spend their time wisely. A computer is what this century uses, and needs. Sometimes, a computer can have the wrong information, but these is more than one sights. If you compare a computer to a book, your information is more limited with the. Have you ever mised the news on television and was eager to learn ? Well the computer is neede them too. The computer teaches you, and informs you what is going on in day life. If you think about it, the television will the news, but the computer can probably inform you. The television is. If there are certain places you need to go of learn about, the fastest way is the computer. Are you understanding my point, @CAPS2, the computer is an easier way of communication. These are many instant messaging sites, or a friendly environment, for ex. facebook. Being able to talk to people on lie computer is less complicated, you killing to a at people. The different variety at people that use the computer to talk probably get rid at their phone and the bill because no one uses it. You can also connect with people in different countries or. If you have a family, you can learn each others traits, and see the difference in religion. The more you know and learn, the more knowledgable and comfortable you'll be if you visit. That is a great experience to rope for. In conclusion, a computer isn't just a waste of time. The computer is just a piece of material that is filled with information and ways to conect with people @CAPS3 is bad about it, unless someone uses it the wrong way, or is distracted. Try to understand, that there is everything you can possibly need to know on the computer!",9
441,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 has been a very interesting question going around lately. Do computers do more positive or negative acts for people? My guess is that they cause much harm for the human race computers are causing many teens and young adults to be unhealthy. Computers are also very expensive, and seem to take away the hand in family. Computer are not enhancing our physical or mental environment. Computers are keeping teens and adults cooped up inside rather than enjoying the natural outdoors. It is important that they get outside or go to the gym in order to stay healthy. Computers seem to be holding them back. A @CAPS2 named @PERSON1 did some research and in a survey of fifty teens only eight of them would rather be outside or exercising rather than going on facebook all day. Computers are bringing down our rate of health. Because of computers people would rather surf the web and order their groceries rather than go to the store and walk around the aisles. Local gym owner @PERSON2 @CAPS3 that since computers have been the cool treend his gym members have been cancelling memberships because they don't have time to get to the gym. they don't have time because they are too busy walking on computer games.

""@CAPS3 of country cuts"" in @LOCATION1 @CAPS4. Computers can be helpful, but to a certain extent. Take my advise and change your life style. Computers are quite expensive especially when everyone is tight on money these days. People are paying extra for games, internet, and even everyday softwear! People are so addicted to computers and they will pay any price for that little satisfactor of going on a pointless website. Computers are having a large impact on us and on our packets. We have been spending too much on computers. Best @CAPS5 cahser @PERSON3 @CAPS3 I never thought people would go out of their way to pay this much crazy"" which goes to prove that the human race will give up their money for computers rather the things family vacations.

442,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 respect my opinion. I think that computers have a positive effect on people. There are three major reasons why I think that. They are: they help people with hand-eye coordination, the ability to learn about faraway places and people increases, and to talk online with others. @CAPS2 respect my opinion; I will defend it throughout the rest of my paper. My first reason defending my opinion is that it helps with hand-eye coordination. This will help you in all sports. Mostly, all sports involve hand-eye coordination . By using it with typing and the computer; it can increase your sport skills. For example, baseball is a sport that needs alot of hand-eye coordination. Typing on the computer and looking up at the screen, at the same time can help you in baseball. It can help you by seeing when the ball is coming and then you swing. That is coming and then you swing. That is my first reason why I think computers have a positive effect on people. My second reason why I think computers have a positive result on people is because they allow you to learn about faraway places and people. For example, if you have a project to do on @LOCATION1 you can search it online and get all of the information you need. A lot of new things have been invented for the computer including languages. So, if you need to learn a language and you don't have time to go to a class; you can learn online the same way. That is my second reason why I think computers have a positive outcome on people. My third reason why I think computers have a positive effect on people is because they get to talk online to people, either through a network, video or audio. For example, if part of your family lives in @LOCATION2, then you can talk to them without the money. You can use networks like @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, or by e-mail. For video messages you can use ooVoo, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS5, etc. You can also use those networks for audio. By interacting over the internet. It is bringing you closer to your family - not farther. That is my third reason why I think computers have a positive effect on people. In conclusion, I think that more than half of the effects computers have on people are positive. My three reasons are: hand-eye coordination, learning about faraway places and people, and to talk online. @CAPS2 respect my opinions.",9
443,"Dear @CAPS1 @NUM1 eye witness news, I have been putting my attention torwds the use of computers. I have noticed that more and more fellow @CAPS2 are indeed addicted to the technology. My concern is that they don't get enough exersize. The other thing I'm worried about is the lack of comunication in families. But my final consern is the safty of your children @CAPS3 a daily exersize rotine is important in every ones life. Well for example, you don't have to struggle watching your weight because you'll be set. In other words your staying fit and focas. But more importantly your keeping yourself healthly. I think that the technology is keeping us from being able to succeed in our health life. I believe that is their wasn't as much internet accees that wouldn't be a problem with the obesity conserns. Communication in any healthy relationship is goal. It's good to talk as a family. I feel that the computer use is keeping us from doing so. Teen agers are hooked on ""@CAPS4 on @CAPS5, twitter, @CAPS6, @ORGANIZATION1!, @ORGANIZATION2"" ect. These websites keep teenagers away from the outside world and family communication. Our society is being brain washed with these new cyber space onlien cummuinities. Your childerns safty is at risk! These online cummunities are putting your child in some serious trouble. These are millions of kids signed on to ""@CAPS7, @CAPS5, twitter, @CAPS6, @ORGANIZATION1!, @ORGANIZATION2"". But as many kids there are there will be more sex-offenders, @CAPS10, and harmful people. Letting your child log on to these is pretty much exposing them into the arms of those people. Remenber its never safe to put any type of information that can harm you or your loved ones. So, I believe that the computer use is just a way to keep you from doing a great life. We all know that we don't want to get hurt so I think that we should limit our computer use. But if your child has one of the websites that were mention please watch out for them.",8
444,"Imagine having the whole world in a screen in front of you. With the @CAPS1 you can socialize more. You can also learn more, quicker and get insperation for things to do away from the computer. I believe that the computer benefits the society. There are so many things on the computer to make socializing more efficient. Rather than sending letters in the mail, which wastes paper, you can send emails to your friends email address. If you want to have a conversation, instead of calling someone far away and get long distance fees, you can talk to them with a webcam. To get in touch with old or new friends you can use social networking sites which are becoming more and more popular. The computer makes socializing easier. If you wanted to learn about a new topic without a computer you would have to drive to the library search for a book then come back to the library to return it. This might discourage some kids from learning. If they used a computer they would quickly be able to find the information they needed on the @CAPS1 without any of the hassel. With this time saver they might have time to learn more about different topics. The computer makes it a lot easier to learn. There are a lot of sites that might inspire people to go out and have fun. For example, if you are learning about animals you would quickly be able to find the nearest zoo and how much it costs. There are even sites with cupons to save money while you are out having fun. There are even sites to tell you where it is fun to go as a family. The computer can inspire fun trips with your friends or family. Overall, the computer has a lot of benefits. It makes socializing and gaining knowledge easier. It can also inspire you to go out and have fun. The computer benefits society.",8
445,"Computer are good to have in society. They teach people about far away places, helps me socailize and lets the person relax. Computers teach people about far away places.

Since I am @NUM1 I can'@CAPS2 use a plane to travel because I'm young. My parents don'@CAPS2 have the money to travel so the computer helps me learn about these places.

On top of that you can even watch some shows that you missed or @CAPS2.V. so you won'@CAPS2 miss out. Finally you can get your own virtual form. Computers aren'@CAPS2 always bad for the society.

446,"Dear local Newspaper, I agree with the experts. I think it is a bad idea to spend all free time on computers. It is always good to go outside and get some fresh air. Also going out and doing activities with friends or family is good too. And the more time you spend on computers, the more likely it is you will become fat! Thats why america is one of the oberstest @ORGANIZATION1 is because we spend more time playing games than exercising or doing activities. Don't you enjoy the feel of the moist air of a spring mornig? I do. Do you think if you stay up all night playing the computer you will be able to witness it? Of course not and you know it. So take a break from @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 @NUM1 and go outside. The fresh air is good for you! So put down the mouse and keyboard and maybe even the head-set and get out and go do something. Who wouldn't ant to go to the fresh or on a snowboarding trip with a friend? I know I definitely would. I love being in the water or @CAPS3 down the @CAPS4 dodging trees! Also hanging out with friends is way matter than being isolated playing @CAPS5.O.@CAPS5 (world of warcraft) for your week with a tower of learning pizza bakers like that guy @LOCATION2 in @LOCATION1. That isn't good. Because if you stop going out your not going to go out anymore! Then your not going to have all the friends you to and once you realize that your going to be upset and your going friends and family. And who couldn't use a good muscle tone? I know I could. Thats why I started playing less computer games and up the basketball and have been playing a ton more of that. For instance me and my team won the @CAPS6 small division league @CAPS7!!! (I'm # @NUM2) we won because our coach made us wors herd, and we got exercise that made our bodies stronger. Thanks to our coach we got the exercise we needed and because of basketball it focused our minds on something else other than computer games. So please get out and get some fresh air. Go out and enjoy nature with friends and family. And don't forget to exercise here and there its good for you.",8
447,"Dear Local newspaper, In my opinion there are god and bad effects with technology ussage, but the bad effects i think, are worse. Manly because children and people of all ages aren't getting enough exercise, and enjoying the world. Also, with being on the computer all the time, they aren't talking, or spending time with friends. One of the main problems in our society is people getting stolen, and you could meet someone bad and tell them personal things if you begin to trust them. So as you can see, computers and technology do have some problems. With being on the computer all the time, kids don't get out, and enjoy the freshair. Clearly if you are on your butt all day, everyday, you are gonna get big, or even worse, obese. If the child is young and is on the computer all the time, he could become afraid of being out side, or just never wanting to. If you are staring at a computer screen a lot you eyes get dry, and make you tired, so you will probably just sleep half the day, and then be on the computer. So you obviously need to be outside everyonce in a while. No-one in the world can live a happy life without someone to talk to and thats whats happening to people cause, they are busy on the computer all the time. So clearly if you don't talk to your friends or ever see them you are gonna lose them. If you lose many friends you could become lonely and depressed, and start hiding from everyone. So you will lose all contact with family too, and then start thinking about suicidale, and other bad things, that's always bad. Everything like myspace and facebook is always gnna have bad people on it. If your child starts talking to this person, and gives out personal information he or she could get stolen from you. Who knows what this person is thinking of doing to this child! She or he could get raped, or even murdered! No parent is gonna wanna have that happen to their child. So as you can all see. Computers can be really bad. But, as long as you get out some, hang out with friends, and stay safe you should be alright!",8
448,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS3 I'm sure you know there I talk about the effect of computers on people. The amount of inquiry about computers is large. I am there to tell you that these claims are inexplicably one hundred percent incorrect. @CAPS3 there are bad claims being made the good claims rise out of the ashes. Did you know that computers cant be good for our society and believing that computers are bad are tearing down society there is nothing wrong with computers. In fact we use it all the time we talk to friends, learn about far away place we @MONTH1 never visit in our lifetime, the computers teach hand-eye cordination to help better type on keyboards, finnaly they offer you the satisfaction of being able to do things on those rainy days that leave you locked in the house with nothing to do. When we are home alone with nobody to talk to hoe well we keep a social life. Well the answer is this socalled ""problem"" that people speak of known @CAPS3 computers. wouldn;t you like the confort of kicking back realxing and talking to your friends on @CAPS1 or @CAPS2. You can really get to know people and connect to family members on the other side of the globe if you wanted to. You know most people have moved from a state or country should you really find it fitting to take away the fastes way to communicate without bringing your phone will every month long distance, no! You know i'm one fiftenth mongollian and i've never been to mongollia. I'm als jewish but i've never been to @LOCATION1 either, doie that mean I'll never learn about them? of course I will, I can get all the information I need about them on my computer. I can find out long , even the such @CAPS3 the biggest mountains or @MONTH1 be the smallest of lakes. Obviously the information I can is rare then I could without a computer to aid me and answer my @CAPS3 well it can teach me about hand eye coordination this will make my typing faster and life easier. Finnaly, on the rainy day in the will you go sleep, eat, watch @CAPS4, or just play around. Well you have to you can go yout computer which offers you more than all of those things. @CAPS3 I've said earlier you can talk to friends, play on line long, or just watch videos on @CAPS5, and all this things and more are offered to you. In conclusion Computers are not a ""problem"" or ""menace to society"" but a key component to our everyday lives and without this in our society would'nt function has it does today it was lack our modern technology and we would live very differently. We use computers to talk to friends, to learn about faraway places, teach handeye coordination, and provides something to do or bad . @CAPS3 you can see computers are okay!",10

I think this because the computer allows people to talk online with others, give the ability to learn about far away places, teach hand-eye coordinations and positive effect on people. Read on and im sure I will support my reasons with my opinion. The computer allows people to talk online with others. I agree with this policy because, if they don't have a house phone or cell phone they can talk to you online instead a paying the phone bill. Talking online is easier than a monthly phone bill. If their was no computer then we would have to pay the phone bill. More and more people should continue talking online a phone does not have a keyboard like the computer does. This is why I believe people should talk online to friends. The computer gives people the ability to learn more about far away places, and people. If the computer was not invented then we would not have to learn more about far away places, and people. The computer gives people facts and other resoures that we need.",6

If you just call your friend there wont be problems. You should always have time for your family you should get fresh air dont be inside all the time if you stay on the computers you can start to gane weight from being in one price at a time. Computers are bad for your brain growth and you need to do other things than staying on the internet.",6
451,"I do not support advances in technology. I feel that people that use too much technology they won't be as healthy, their social skills will decrease, and more businesses will close. A healthy body is important to every human. But healthiness @MONTH1 be a problem with more technology. If you are on the computer all day, where are you going to find time to excercise? When you eat it needs to be balanced by doing something rather than sitting in a chair. A screen on your computer seems harmless, but really the bright flashes it gives off can really damage your eyes. Being social is a very big part of your life. It's how you make friends and form bonds. Technology, like cell phones, are a disadvantages to a social life. While texting you can't tell if someone is joking, serious, or happy. The texting language used could be a misunderstanding and hurt feelings. It is better to go and talk to the friend in person. Also, if you stay in the house all day, every day, on the computer or playing video games, you might lose some social skills. Then, talking to new people will be harder. Going shopping with your mom might not be too fun, but you have to get food and clothes. If technology grows this activity won't be available. Buying supplies online will be easier and faster. As a result, car companies will go out of business. Our economy isn't doing too good right now, so why do more harm to it? In conclusion, technology will take away our health, social skills, and businesses. Do we want this? No, advances in technology are harmful to the human race and the world.",8
452,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 we like it or not, our society is transforming into a life revolving around technology. This change is inevitable, and, in my opinion, is a positive. By having computers, we as a world are able to advance and recch our highest potential. Therefore, because computers teach hand-eye coordination supply us with research information and allow is to communicate. I believe that computers are a positive contribution to society. To start I believe computers are a positive contribution to society because they teach hand-eye coordination. By developing the skill, individuals can move on to other activities that involve hand-eye coordination such as tennis. Also, the skill of han-eye coordination can also be used in the workforce and @MONTH1 be essential to mantaining a steady job. Either way it is safe to say that by developing hand-eye coordination by using computers, it can end up being a great skill to have as you proceed through life. Another positive contribution given to society by computers is the ability to have information on nearly everything in a matter of seconds. This is beneficial on aspects of learning such as research projects where the desired information is scorcely found in books. By having a computer for research though, the needed information can be found with the click of a button. The computer can also help when you are planning to make an investment but would like to research it prior. You are able to acess customer reviews on the product, or the best price between multiple stores. Lastly, a culture or group of people can be researched and with a firm understanding, their is a chance that they @MONTH1 to be more resacked int the future. Lastly, computers allow those from all around the globe to communicate easily, quickly, and effectively in many ways. To start, computers can help us alert other nations of approaching natural disasters, or they can do the same for us such as what occur of between click and. With a simple computer, thousands of lives could be spared from injury, (or worse). Computers also allow us to send information back from outer space with the pressing issue of overpopulation predicted in the future it is vital that we are looking for alternative ""homes"" in outer space. Thus, the information we gather and transfer back to earth through computers is essential to our societies well being computers can also allow people to stay in touch with their family and friends. Regardless of their locations, computers allow people to solitify their bond through instant message, emails, or face to face video chats. As I previously stated, our world is beginning to revolve around technology, and we can't bring this trend to a hault. Instead of looking at computers as a negetive, we need to view them as the positive tool that develops hand-eye coordination and assist in research and communication and embrace them to the fullest.",10

Some people don'@CAPS1 get there chorces done because they always on the computer then when there parents come home they get on punisment. I think thats why students don'@CAPS1 do there homework because the be playing video games on the computer. Once you get on its like you can'@CAPS1 log off its like watching @CAPS1.V but you on the computer. However people have chorces to do when they come home from school they say well well mine parents an'@CAPS1 home I could do what ever I want to do then when there parents do comes home they wonder why they get on punishment because they didn'@CAPS1 do what there parents said. Its good being a parent to teach there child from right to wrong. Certainly when the teacher ask us for our homework most students say oh I don'@CAPS1 know I didn'@CAPS1 feel like doing my homework and the teacher ask why? because I was either hanging out with my friends or on the computer or playing video games all day. That why students get the grades they get because they not focus on school. It's best to used the computer fo school projects too not just video games. The only good time that its good to go on the computer is when you ask your parents to go on and you did everything that you were suppose to do. Its best to go on lot a on the weekeneds because many people be on thats more of your friends you could talk to. When you get on it's hard to log off because you get amazed by all the things you can look at on the computer. Its like watching @CAPS1.V you be focus more. I want the local newspaper to agree with my prompt because my reasons are good reasons. You don'@CAPS1 do your chorces you get in trouble. Most people don'@CAPS1 do there homework they focus on video games. Ask before you go on the computer and then everything will be fine.,8
457,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 has come to my attention that there is a debate whether the advancement in computer technology is a good or bad thing. Some experts believe that people don't excercise, spend time with their famalies, or enjoy nature due to computers. However, I believe that the advances in computer sciences are very much needed. I believe there are three reasons why we should support advances in computers, the first reason is simple in the buisnesses they always need better technology. The second reason is that computers are slowly replacing a lot of things. The last reason is we need to keep up with the other countries. I believe that the businesses will always need the next new program at application. A perfect example of this would be the @ORGANIZATION3 telecommunications systems this applications helps businesses that are global, talk to their different branches without sending a representative to all the branches around the world. Another key program that is always going to be needed is power point, I'm sure @CAPS2 would quite embarrasing to use @ORGANIZATION2 windows @NUM1 to pitch your ideas to a corporate sponsor, who has had an upgrade for quite some time. I think that computers are also beginning to replace many popular recreational tools of the past for example, look at television you can now go to websites that display your favorite television show sometimes commercial free. I know also that the trend of buying @CAPS3's is slowly starting to decline, with the @DATE1 invention of @ORGANIZATION4's @CAPS4 on @NUM2 player with the ability to hold more than @NUM3 songs! The @CAPS4 surely beat @CAPS3 players, along with the @CAPS4 came @CAPS5 an application where you can buy and dowload songs, movies and games, with prices ranging from @MONEY2 - @MONEY1. My last reason of why the advancement of computers is positive is because the government needs to keep up with the other countries. If the @LOCATION1 were to not have the technology that could comprehend enemy intel, then our counter @ORGANIZATION1 would not make enough important progress to keep our nation safe. Another reason is that without certain robotics many people would have to live with fake arms, and or other body parts.

Computers can also be used to connect with family and friends, and the computer can have useful games that can help us. The computer definitely has positive effects on people. for school and any other educational purposes, the computer can be very useful for @CAPS2. Computers can help @CAPS2 with their homework or projects with a click of a button. They can research about any topic online and use that information if they don't have time to go to the library. The computer also has @ORGANIZATION2, a program that is often used at home, offices, and even in school. With this program, @CAPS2 can type up their paper and just print to have a neat copy that they can turn in. Teachers also think that the computer can be very useful when it comes in education. In a survey, @PERCENT1 of teachers use the @CAPS1 or any other program on the computer to try and learn a lesson. More and more teachers are discovering educational websites and programs that can help @CAPS2 learn a subject. @CAPS2 also take a liking to that subject when they find that they can interact with the subject online. It can make the subject more enjoyable for the @CAPS2 to learn, and for the teachers to teach. Computers will always be on the aide of education. People can also use the computer to interact with friends and family online. Family you don't see for years can be reconnected with you through video chatting or instant messaging. You can also reconnect with people who live far away. Through websites like @CAPS3 and @ORGANIZATION3, people can talk to their friends and family more easily. @PERCENT2 of teenagers would rather talk to their friends through the computer than talking to their friends through the telephone. It is more enjoyable to see your friend while talking to them if you are videochatting. That is what you can use the webcam for. many people have the webcam and they use it for connecting with friends and family. It is a great way to be social and branch out to your peers. You can also use the @CAPS1 to meet new people and learn about others who you have never met before. Computers are a great way to connect with friends and family and be social. Computers can also be very useful for @CAPS4, groups, and committees that are trying to reach out to the other people. As the @ORGANIZATION1, a widely known newspaper I'm sure you have a website that readers can log onto and learn more about your newspaper @CAPS4 use the @CAPS1 to create websites that can inform buyers, partners, or other people who want to find out more about their business. And through the @CAPS1, they can also advertise their business if they wish. It is very useful and can earn you a lot of money by attracting customers to buy your products. Groups like the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 can use the @CAPS1 to inform citizens of what they are trying to get people to support and to acknowledge the awareness of the importance of that group. They can use the @CAPS1 to gather supporters and expand their group. @CAPS4, groups and committees will use the computer to lure in customers and supporters which will earn them much money. The computer can be useful for many different reasons and it will always be advancing our new technology of the day. Whether used for educational purposes, social purposes, or business purposes, the computer has a positive effect on people.",11
460,"Dear @CAPS1, Are computer a good thing for out society? Is'nt it possible that this is @CAPS5 dangerous people can be. Child pornography, fake people using some one elses name. Also, it's a lack of exersise, obesity is increasing alot in the @ORGANIZATION1 due to this technology. What about the other important things in life like your family, your friends. Wont you eventually lost them forever? First, children communicate on @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 but do they really know is it's their friends or a sick man playin a joke. I was reading an article about a @NUM1 year old girl who commited suicide, because aof a boy she met on @CAPS3 left her. Her parents in the end found out this was a hoax from their neighbors to see it she was talking about her to other students. Also the internet is full of child pornography because girls want to send it to their boyfriend yet it gets posted every where or landed in to the wrong hands. In this case it's a serious matter so that a negative benift computers have on us human? Next, @CAPS5 many hours do you think a teenagers are addicted to the computer? Do you think they ever exersise? Each year obesity is increasing tremendously. It's not only junk food we eat but since we never exersise due to lack of good nuitrtion or for always being on the computer. I see people who are always on @CAPS3 who have trouble breathing for walking a bright of stars. That is very upsetting! Another reason, when was the last time you had a heart to heart conversation with your child. Is he/she to busy conversating with their friends. I learned this from experince my mother and I aren't as close as we used to be because I'm alway on the internet. Now that I try to talk to her she has aswell became too adicted. The last time we had a family dinner was most likely a year a go. It's really said to see others family do the same. What about your friends who don not have a @CAPS3 or @CAPS2 you end up using contact with them even though they never did anything wrong. In conclusion, @CAPS9 not saying technology is bad but it has it's negative parts. The technology isn't safe anymore. It has become a dangerous place for us teens or adults. The lack of exersise because you are to addicted to the computer hastly losing touch with your family not spending times with them. What about your friends are you going to abbandon them when they don't deserve it. think about that.",9
461,"Dear @CAPS1 @PERSON2, @CAPS2 a world over run by people who cannot drive, walk, talk or do simple tasks like that all because of bad hand-eye coordination. Computers improve hand-eye coordination, allow people to learn about far away people and places, and give people the opportunity to interact with others. We should have computers. First, computers improve peoples hand-eye coordination. @PERSON1 a leading brain doctor, says that computers cut rehabilitation rates of people who suffered from stroke and spinal injuries in half. Also, when children were exposed to computers at an early age they learned to read, write, walk, and talk faster than children who were not exposed to them. In addition, those skills lasted throut their lives, allowing them to learn to drive, and eventually get better jobs. The @ORGANIZATION2 was quoted saying, “ @CAPS3 skills should be the #@NUM1 priority for a good education.” @CAPS4, people that use computers can learn about far away people and places without actually being there. In a recent study, children ages @NUM2 scored @PERCENT1 more on average when using computer compared with traditional learning methods. Not all people have access to books and need computers to get a good education. It also improves when they used computer, and it’s a fact that kids got into better coledges with the help of computers. Don’t you want people to be smarter @PERSON2. Last, @CAPS5 people in remote areas only way of communications is through computers. In a poll done by the @ORGANIZATION1 it proved that people in desolat places communicated through computers. In adition, you do not need to be with that person to talk to them so it is a major advantage for long distance relationships. I know that without computers, I would never be able to stay in touch with my best friend that moved to @LOCATION1. Picture a world where there is never any car accidents, your children can walk at the age of @NUM3 months old, and everybody is never tripping over their own feet. Computers improve hand-eye coordination, allow people to learn about things that they normally cant, and create @ORGANIZATION2 path ways for communication. So get out there, @CAPS1 @PERSON2, and tell the world to keep computers.",9
462,"I think that computers have positve effects on people. My first reason is because it lets you communicate with other people. It helps you do your schoolwork and understand things better. You can also do cool projects and fun stuff. My first reason is because it lets you communicate with other people. If your absent at school and you don't know what the work was you can ask your friends or even your teacher. If you have a friend and he or she moved to another country you can still talk to them with websites like aim or facebook. For example I used to lived in @ORGANIZATION1 and I moved to the @LOCATION1, but I can still talk to my old friends. You can also communicate with your friends if you want to go outside and play soccer or basketball. My second reason is it helps you do your homework and understand things better. If your teacher told you to find the definition for genre and you don't know what it means you can always websites like google or dictionary. And sometime you need the computer to do your homework, my teacher told me to make a blog about a book after I finished it. Sometimes when your watching a show on television and you don't know what something means you can always look it up. Like one time I was watching @CAPS1 and this kid said ""carly you will rue this day"" I looked up rue and understood what he meant. My third reason is because you can do cool projects and fun stuff. When you are bored you can play games. For example on time it was raining so i couldn't go outside and i went to addicting games.com and played puzzle games all day. When my mom was doing a garage sale she told me to make some adds telling people when and where is the garage sale, so I went in the computer and made the paper more interesting by putting pictures of baseballs, soccerballs and other stuff in it. And you can also lean more stuff with a computer, like how to write a perfect essay, but everything doesn't have to be about school, it can also help you in your future like how to design clothes or houses, or even ride an airplane. So parents @MONTH1 think ""my kids don't want to go outside anymore because their too busy in the computer"". But maybe is the parents fail for that encourage them to go outside and join a sport team. But I think computers have positive effects on kids because it lets them communicate with people that are in other countries. It helps you do your schoolwork and understand things better. And you can do cool projects and fun stuff.",9
463,"Dear local newspaper, I believe and strongly suggest that people should use computers, computers have a good effect on people by giving people the ability to learn online and take college courses, allow people to talk online using social networking sites, and gives you the chance to find the local news if you don't have cable. One reason I think computers have a good effect on people is that you can learn a lot on the computer and even take college courses! Online can go onto a search engine and type in something you want to research. And in seconds whatever you typed in, links will pop-up bringing you to what you want to learn about. You can learn about @LOCATION1 and about their history or you can look up about Online, you can take college courses and get a degree even. You can be relaxing at home and can get college credits! Another reason that computers have a good effect on people is that people can talk online, On a social networking site, @CAPS1 facebook, you can look up old friends from high school and reconnect, @CAPS1 if they live in @LOCATION2 and you live an @STATE1 you can chat online and stuff. Its also great if you want to talk to family that live far away. You can have a webcam and then you can actually see them and talk and they can see you! The last reason is that if you heard about something and didn't really know but you can find out that stuff online. Online you can look up local or worldwide news online. If you go on the computer and type in your newspaper and they have a website you can read all about whats happening in your town. So I believe and strongly suggest that people should use computers and that they have a good effect on people. So if you want college credits or learn about places you don't know get a computer and it will have a good effect on you, also.",8
464,"Dear Local Newspaper, More and more people use computers, but not everyone carees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. I strongly disagree. Some people are concerned that people spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends. Please continue to discover my disagreeing opinions. @PERSON1, professional singer @LOCATION1 ""Spending too much time on the computers is not all that great for you. Why? Well, because computers take more time, and less time exercising and staying healthy. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 kids in the @LOCATION1 get obese from computer attention. You wouldn't want green eyes, and regular size weight gaining more and? I bet you wouldn't want that. Has it ever occured to you, how beautiful nature can be? Imagine nobody outside enjoying the beautiful. Seeing every single kid, even adults. Imagine that! wouldn't you love to have a relaxing day of nature having those laughing having a time outdoors and your child getting exercise at the same time! Not only that but having computers is a waste of time! @PERCENT1 of families across the nation have family issues only because of computers! I remember one time when my brother got this new computer game called @CAPS1.O.@CAPS1 (@CAPS2 of @CAPS3) it was a popular computer game. My mom told him to turn it off and do some exercise, they started bicker alot. Things like this can ruin relationship and interaction with your family members. As you can see, computers can cause a bunch of horrible things like the ones I have mentioned in this essay. Wouldn't you want a healthy life for your child? If so, computers do the opposite. If you had to write an essay about computers, would you agree or disagree?",9
465,"What effect do you believe computers have? My opinion is that computers have a positive effect on people. I believe this because, first our government runs on computers. Next, we can search the web when ever we need to find new about stuff. Finally, kids can study and do projects online. To begin, I think computers have a positive effect on people because our whole goverment runs on them. Without computers our state could be a disaster! Our government uses them to keep tracks of their files. They use computers to keep important data. Whether its for money, meetings or anything else. We can always count on computers to keep us on tract and organized. Next, computers can help us a lot in this world. Another reason why they are a positive thing is because we can always go online to see important news we need to know. Most people are way to busy to watch t.v., others just watch the news but when you turn on the t.v. Its too late! Well the first thought that comes to peoples minds is the computer. Many parents use them to check for delays on snowy days or other news that @MONTH1 concern them. I know this because it a personal experience! Lastly, computers are a good thing because kids can do projects, study or homework. Without computers kids wouldn't be so advance as they are now. In the internet kids can learn by playing educational games. They can use the computer to find biographies of a person's life far a project or homework. Not only kids can use. It, but also @CAPS1. If a parent wants to finish school they could take online classes. Most people think computers have negative effects on people but there way more positive effect because it more educational and helpful than people think. In conclusion, I think computers are a positve effect on people because of the reasons I listed before. First, our goverment runs on computers. Next, we search the web to find important news. Lastly, kids can use it for educational purposes. For the most part I think computers are very important in this world. Now the question is. Do you think computers are a negative or positive effect on people?",9
466,"What do you think about computers? Computers are the name of a new age and everyone is all about the online activities that allow you to have an updated mind. The computer is twice as fast than a book, it tells you. X ammount of facts on what your searching on. The computer isn't just for research, there is other ways to use it like online chatting, gaming, and gaves you the option to meet new people and make new friends. Computers can be used for just about anything! To help your vocabulary to communitcating and making your learning abilities better. The computer is the center of our universe. The computer is twice as fast than the average book. In books, you have a whole five extra steps to finding what you want. Take looking in an dictionary for example. The index tells you what page, it is what your trying to find item. Sometimes you struggle to find it, once you have found it, it @MONTH1 not be what your looking for. Or, you @MONTH1 not understand. The computer is a one step process, and ahead of the game. It immedietly takes you to your designated question. If one response isn't the right one, then theres @NUM1 more that sure enough, is what your trying fo find, and the more specific you get an your search, the & faster your answer will find you! Books @MONTH1 have been in the @LOCATION1 ages, and the information isn't always up to date. Computers have the power to update and make better explanations, or web pages on your finding. Books are printed once and millions of copies are made, all the information stays the same. In the world we live in now, new stories and news comes up every minute of our life. You would never find a out of the blue in a news update that happened yesterday. Computers are million of people every day are informed by the internet in a matter of seconds. This is just the various are better than the book. Computers have the power to enhance your abilities, your vocabulary and communication skills, just like a book would. But yet again the computer is faster, updated and everyone is on it. As much as books help with learning new words or communication skills, the computer can do the same thing but explain twice as good and there are a lot of different ways to learn what your trying to find than in a book. The computer also allows you to meet other people. It gives you the chance to make a new friend or maybe start a new life. The computer isn't just for learning, and this is why everyone loves it. Now I understanding there are people out there who hack these computers and stalk you, but there's also the option to upload @CAPS1-virus servers to block them from getting at you! If youre smart enough, bad things wont happen to you! What do you think about computers? The average person is in love with this wonderful creation. Computers are the center of our universe and the name to a new age. The computer is like god! Always there for you, it never let's you down and is always a good thing to have. This is why I think computers are better than the average book.",10
467,"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, I have heard talk going around about computers. People are saying they are bad because they take away @CAPS1 much of our lives. I say that isn't true. We do spend a lot of time on computers but that doesn't necacerally mean we are wasting our time. Computers provide us with infinente knoledge. They allow us to talk to our friends and family across the world, and they have allowed human society to take massive leaps in everyday things. First, they provide infinete amounts of knowlegde. Today, you can find just about any thing you want on a computer. An expieriment was conducted last year by a @ORGANIZATION1 proffesor, who @ORGANIZATION1 people and society. Professor @PERSON1 took a pole to see what people did when faced with difficult, everyday questions. He went house to house and risked average people. Over <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of them went straight to their computers or laptops to look it up. Another <@PERCENT1@NUM2> took out thier cell phones, went on the internet and looked it up. The last @PERCENT1 said ""I don't know"" and walked away. This adds up to a total of <@PERCENT1@NUM3> of people who use their computers or internet. Is that a large number of people or what? This reminds me about a good friend of mine from a while ago. He got onto the gameshow ""@CAPS1 you wanna be a @CAPS2?"" and was doing pretty well. We went to his @ORGANIZATION3 house to watch it with her. She is a very intelegent woman, but doesn't know every thing. @CAPS4 friend ended up winning @MONEY1 because of a computer. He get stuck on a question and used phone a friend. When he did this, the phone in his @ORGANIZATION3 house started ringing. I hadn't even celized it but she was already up and at the computer  it up. She found it in less than @NUM4 seconds, gave him the answer, and won him @MONEY2. What would've happened if she didn't have that computer? They would've gotten nothing. You see, publishing if it weren't for that computer, even for that one website, he would have sot. This website is called, ""@CAPS3"". @CAPS3 is the #@NUM5 most used website. I provides countless websites and information for just about anything. Isn't that helpful? @CAPS4 second reason involves family and friends. Websites susch as yahoo and facebook, allow you to instant messages from across the world. Others like @ORGANIZATION4 allow you to web chat with someone, you can see them on the computer monitor and hear them too. For example, @CAPS4 mon works for a company called ganz. She is constatnly traveling places. Even now, as im writing this, she is on a plane flying to @LOCATION6, @LOCATION1. She also goes to @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3,  places in @LOCATION4, and to @LOCATION5 as well. Most of these trips last only a week or @CAPS1, except for @LOCATION5. She goes to @LOCATION5 @NUM6 out of @NUM7 months every year. She misses @DATE2, and @DATE1. @DATE1 is the worst for me. Not only does she miss halloween, but she misses @CAPS4 birthday. I am @NUM8 right now and the last time @CAPS4 mother was home for @CAPS4 birthday was when I was @NUM9. I can't take it but on @CAPS4 birthday she sets aside two times to talk to me on @ORGANIZATION4. @ORGANIZATION2, if you take away computers you take away the only chance for me to talk to @CAPS4 mother for weeks at a time. @CAPS4 last reason is about computers and the advances they help us make.",10
468,"Dear local newspaper, Have you ever been playing a game to the point where you want to hurt other people? Or even to the point your family thinks your out of the country? Many people depend on the computer too much either for entertainment or to get their feelings out. But the more you spend on the computer the more you are forgeting about your family and that you need to stay calm around other people. Not only to you become more independent and agressive and the lack of exercising adds weight to your body. When people use the computer it is because they have nothing to do. So instead going for a walk they just sit there talking or playing with other people online. This makes the person more agressive towards other people. Also this time of time with your mother or father. This time spend with your family could help you with self extreme, social skills, and politeness. People all around the world are fat because of poor diet and no exercising. When you are on the computer this makes you want food fast. Most people would eat a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 for a fast meal which adds more than enough calories to that persons diet. On the computer you dont know who would want to talk to some miles and miles away. That person could be a who out of prison. You dont know if they know who you are and where you live. So if they you, you dont know what to do call the police. Also many people can hack your computer and steal your personal files and pictures. This can show the person were you live or even what your doing on the computer. Many deaths have been online because people one who is sensitive. On @CAPS3 you can put things on peoples and see who talk to. That's just like and @CAPS4.",8
469,"I certainly think that computers are a positive thing, @PERCENT1 of americans have atleast one in their household. The computer is an excellent source of knowledge, a good place for socializing and also an easy way to research and do projects. First of all, the computer can make you smarter. You can learn things you never knew before. You can learn about things all over the world. The internet also gives us important facts they no where else can. The computer is definitly an excellent way to be informed about lots. Secondly, the internet is a great way for socializing. If you could not talk to relitives in another country on a telephone, you could chat with them lots of teenagers that are trying to make plans go on the internet to chat with close friends. Isually go on facebook when I need to talk with someone that dosn't hve a cell phone either. It is so easy. Lastly, the computer is an amazing way to do on projects for or even work. You can research any topic you want and get the race about it. Next time you need to get the facts, just go on the internet and google it. I'm sure you will find a lot on it. The internet has almost anything you need. I definitly think that is amazing. As you can see, the computer has a lot of wonderful, useful things. It can teach you important things, it is great for social networking and it is also an amazing place for researching topics you wish you knew more about. It is great to have a computer. If you are afraid to either get a computer or not, I am telling you to get one! Go out and learn more about them. There are certainly, positive aspects for having a computer in your life.",8
470,"I believe that computers do come in many at times but people should spend less time on them for many reasons such as being fit and healthy being secure and safe and exploring the beautiful world we live in. The reason why I believe that computers have a negative affect an being fit and healthy is because one of my mathers friends pretty much spent three years wasting her time on the internet and gained over @NUM1 pounds. Another reason is because when your on the computer, you soon to get hungry of course so what do you do., snack on @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 @CAPS3. The reason why I beleive the internet isn't always safe is because I went an a chatroom called ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5"" and when I logged in I @CAPS6 in the main chat that people were hooking up and trying to find where one and another live, but thats not even the worst part, one of @MONTH1 friends went on a chatroom and my friend talked to this guy who was @NUM2 and she was @NUM3, anyways she talked to him about every other day far about a year and she finally decided to trust him and give him some of her private information such as where she lives and what not. He found out pretty much everything about her and the next time they talked he called her inapropiate names and told her he was going to kill her, plus, he doesn't live very far, he lives in @LOCATION1. Lastbut not least the reason why it's important to explore the outdoors is because nobody wants a lonely life and if you sit down at the computer all day it's bound to happen. Also you need to explore this world because you only have one life and your wasting it on flash games, @CAPS7, @CAPS8 or some other websites. Alright you guys, you could go on the computer just not for long, that keyboard and monitor are on addiction! And you could be fit and healthy, secured and safe and explore this beautiful world we live in, now isnt that exhilarating?",9
471,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 I had to support on people using ccmputers to people going out and getting the exercise. It would be people getting the exercise in this prompt im going to be explaning why I agree on people getting out instead of people going on the computer. One is that computers are making the postal services go bankrupt more and more people are getting obese and lastly kids are going on the wrong websites and meeting up with people. More and more people are getting computers and using them daily to pay bills, shop online, ect and this is making the postal services go bankrupt. The postal services arnt getting any mail to sent out so there not getting payed. Also when you buy things online it goes to fedex or ups so the postal sevices dosnt get any mail or packages to send or it. I think people are getting to lazy and doing everything on computers and thats not good for buisneses. More and more family are getting obese. Computers are ruinning and messing up familys lives without them noticing. Computers are throwing off a steady exercise plan for the family like going for a walk going to the park and many other things. Familys nutrition is getting ruined and messed up lik instead of having breakfast lunch and dinner they grab a hag of chips and fast off that. Teenagers are getting hurt, raped, and sexually nelested. I think some teenagers boy or girl dont no how powerful the internet is. When a teenager gets a message and they dont no who it is they look at the picture to see @CAPS3 its a cute girl or a cute boy they start talking to them. What some teenagers dont no is that they can put a fake picture on there facebook or myspace and tell them to met up at some location so that they can kidnap you and rape and kill you. Computers are ruining people lives one after another. In this prompt I explained my case on people using computers to people getting out and getting the exercise. I have told you about computers making the postal services go bankrupt, familys getting obese and kids are getting raped and sexually melested.",9
472,"Dear @CAPS1, I believe that its true some people do spend more time on their @CAPS3 then they do with ther Family. Their actually not even excercising at and the bad thing they the majority of that people are kids. They spend to much time on their @CAPS3 that they dont excercise at all and because of that their overfat. Many of them get the illness called @CAPS2 wich is realy @CAPS2 makers you have to control your sugar and pressure. Many people think that computers are really good but their not! how I know this? well because computers where made by a human, and humans are not perffect. A @CAPS3 could maybe help student's in school, and for many parents the @CAPS3 is the test solition! Education is very important and so thats why almost every child in the @CAPS4.S of america has one. Computers could help kids with their @CAPS5 it could help kids that work with their jobs. it could even help parents with their bussines. People who support the advances of technology believe that computers have a good positive effect on people but in the other hand people dont even eat in a whole day just to be on a @CAPS3, @CAPS6 my sister I really hate when I cooke and she dont even says she's there. It gets me aggrevated when I see little kids overfat because stil they do is sit around and use a @CAPS3. I think parents shouldnt let their childs use a @CAPS3 a whole day. Many jobs requine a @CAPS3. Just @CAPS6 a schol does. or any other business does. and that why I think people should atless exercise @NUM1 days a week, so that their bodies will stay healthy and strong.",7
473,Dear local newspaper people In my opinion I think that people should get off there computers and go spend time hanging out with their friends and exercising. Also to play with their pets too. First I will provide facts on how you need to hang out with you friend instead of being on the computer because a computer does not tell anything about your friend. Also you don't see your friend. You can't tell your friend about your own problems because you can get hacked. Second you need exersize because your body need to be healthy. You could also suffer health problems if you are always on the computer like develope bad eyesite or become obese and can't workout. Third is that your pet needs attion to you just can't buy one and then leave it alone for the rest of his life. Your pet need as much loveing as much time you spend on your computer. If you do not spend as much time with your pet as you do with your computer then the pet will abanden you.,6
474,"Dear newspaper, I think that computers do benefit the society. They are very educational. Its another way to communicate with people and make new friends. They also help with exercising and enjoying nature. Computers benefit society in different many ways. To start, computers are educational. There are websites you can go to to look up history or how to do a science experiment. Also, if your mom or dad is at work and can't take you to a tutor there is online tutoring for all ages. Not to mention it teaches you hand and eye coordination. It also helps you learn about the world around you faster for instance, if a building were to fall or something it would be online almost right after it happened. These are reasons why computers are educational. Also, computers are another way to communicate with people and make new friends. For example, e-mail, if you're trying to reach someone and they'renot anwsering their phone or their text messages or their pager e-mail is another and resource. As soon as you send it, it's there, you don't need bars or signals if you've got internet you can send an e-mail to anyone in less than @NUM1 minutes! If you have a website, you can post things on your website, that helps you communicate with anyone who sees that website. Speaking of websites, there are websites like ""facebook"" where you can make new friends and meet new people. Therefore computers are good communication for people everywhere. Computers help you with activities and enjoying nature. For instance, if you want to go on a hike you can look & what type on or . This helps you stay safe on a hike or if you're camping if you're looking for a gym so you can exercise a computer is a great resource for that as well. Or if you're looking for directions to a certain park or a certain soccer feild a computer can most defenitely help you with that this way you're not late for a soccer game or meeting your friend for a pic-nic in the park. A computer is a big help when it comes to nature, exercising or doing fun activities. In conclusion, computers are a great benefit to society. They are very educational. They're another way to communicate and make friends. Plus they help you enjoy nature and exercise saftely and more effecient. These are big effects that computers have on people.",9
475,"Dear Local Newspaper. I am writing you this letter to inform you of reasons that computers have a positive effect on people. From kids in school using them to collage students, people use them everyday; for work to just learning in everyday life computers are giving off a positive effect on people. When you pick up your kinder gardener or @NUM1 grader from school you ask them what did you do/learn today. and on most days @NUM2 out of @NUM3 kids say the did something relating to a computer. Some of them say they played a game about adding or subtracting or maybe they are starting to learn how to type. Your @NUM4 and @NUM5 graders said they are typing an essay about @NUM6 or the @CAPS1 on notes they took off of google. But, the big fact is that kids in elementary school all the way to middle school are learning how to use the computer. When they reach high school they have the option to take a class on how to use the computer all the time. Today when you are looking for a job, companies/business usually look for computers background because most jobs require some sort of a computer. If you are a bank teller you use the computer to look up people who need to pay bills or are withdrawing/depositing money into their account. Even a construction worker uses a computer to order supplies or contact a worker. The truth is today @NUM7 out of @NUM8 families use a computer daily. Even when you call @NUM9 they use a computer to find on a map where the accident/emergency is to get there faster. When a mother is at home while the kids are at school and the husband is at work she is usually on the computer. Checking the news, e-mailing her buff's, or her husband at work. Maybe she searching to find the perfect shelter to adopt a dog at in @LOCATION2. When her @NUM10 year old daughter gets home she @CAPS2's her boyfriend on vacation in @LOCATION3. Then she searches on her report about an indian tribe in the @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION1. Their wide family uses the computer daily. So, could you please take this letter into consideration. All ages use the computer for school & work so they would see on your webpage if you respond to my letter. Thank you for reading about how everyone uses computers, for school, jobs, and everyday life!!! Thank you",9
476,"Dear Local @CAPS1, Computers is a big divice used to look up different things. You can look up animals, cars, diffrent appliences. A computer gives you anything that you can't find in the stores but most of the time you order and the supplies what your looking for get, sent to you. Also if you don't have a @CAPS2 and you want to see the @CAPS1 your computer gives you a lot of information. Some of the new computers gives you a lot of information. Some of the new computers is a lot of money like , @NUM1, @MONEY1. The things you can do without going on the computer every five minutes. Computers can cause blindness, brain damage, head akes, if your at work on the computer at the hospital checking patcients in or playing games. the lighting on the computer, the words makes your brain or eyes go blury or constintly looking. Also you can catch cramps in your hands by clicking.",6
477,"My standing postion on this cause is that computers are good for are technolgy today but if you think that your son or daughter is using today then you can put and block on how long they are on, also it can get comunacation from all arouind the world, and it has the speed of light so you can research stuff and do everythin gyou need to do faster. My first reason is that you can put a block on how long you or your children are on the computer. So if you are one of those pepiole who think that your son or daughter is on the computer to long then you can just put a block on it so they are not on it for more then you want them to be. Also if you think they are on sites they shouldt be then you can put a filter on the intrernet so they cant go on certain things. Also if they are on to long then you can just tell them they cant go on the computer for the rest of the night or sometning like that it is not there fault that pepole lose track of time and what if it is something that needs to be done by tonight and it is a really long thing they have to do or it is for there jobs. Also another one of my reason why computers are more helpful then not is they can let you talk to pepole from all around the world. One is they have chatting sites where you can blog and find new pepole to meet althought there are pepole who do make stuff for the rong purposes nowadays they have moniutours that matchi this things and do reasearch about them once they make a account so if they have done something then they will be closely watched by addminostratiors. Also what if you know someone who moved away and you still want to talk to them you can because of your computer and pepole always say use the phone what if you dont like to talk on the phone or you do like to talk on the phone but at your house you dont get cellphone service there and you cant talk to them because it is staticy so you can use your computer or laptop to chat with them over the web. Or maybe you want to talk to your cousins that moved away and you liked to talk to them a lot but you cant anymore. That is my seconde reason why computers are a good thing. My third reason is that you can search stuff a lot faster threew the computer then you can go threw a book cause a book you have to look for the right book then you have to find a good section of it but on the internet you can just go on a search enginge and you can search right what you need and most of the sites have a description of the site ritght under the web addres so you can see if it what you are looking for. Also what if you ned to have a job paper in tomrrow and you just got it and needs to be about something you dont know about at all you can ask someone over the web to help you and tell you what it is about so you can get it done and keep your job. Maybe in school you need to do a paper for a class and it is a new topic that you have never heard of and you need help witht eht work there are some sites that ave homework help on the wep that you can ask aosmone a question adnt ehy can help you answer it in a short answer or a long one if you need it and they will responde to you either in a little while or right away amnd it is ussaualy right away or in a couple minutes so they can help somone else. Also if you dont belive your computer is runing fast anymore you can just go onto some sites that will inhance your computer speed for no money at all unlike those downloading disk that take forever it is a statistic that for every one disk that someone buy there are @NUM1 pepole who use they intrernet to inhance the speed of your computer so it is 1/@NUM1 of the people who use the internet to inance your internet in minutes instead of those long periods to download instal on the computer that slow disk. That is my third reason why I hitnk that computers are a lot more helpfull then they are'nt.",12
478,"@CAPS3 I think about Computers in Society is that, it has great positive effects on People. People can learn things about things in and out of this world. And allows to talk to other people when they need to. Computers could be the best thing that ever happened to us. One @CAPS1 why Computers can be good because its technology can teach people that want to learn about the @CAPS2. Or More, they want to learn about space and planets. Or Learn @CAPS3 @CAPS4 of species are out there. And learn new places for visiting. Another good @CAPS1 is @CAPS5 with other people. Can be d best @CAPS6 you want to talk to. Be part of a good Society @CAPS7. Or @ORGANIZATION1 online with a credit @CAPS8 on a @CAPS9 or Other things like @ORGANIZATION3's @CAPS10. There are @CAPS11 good @CAPS12 you can @CAPS14 on the @ORGANIZATION2. Like I stated above Computers can be used to learn things in life. Can be used to chat with @CAPS6 and other people. People @CAPS14 bad stuff but, its @CAPS3 they @CAPS14 not the people that use it for good. So theres my good effects it does to humans Computers. ",7
479,"Dear local @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I feel that computers do benifit our society now I know you @MONTH1 not feel or share the same opinion as I do but I want to show and explain to you how computers have a good effect on the people of our society. Computers help people find jobs and even find better prices on thing that you would find in a store. Computers also help shy people who won't as socialy active as others have someone to talk to. And lastly computers teach you a lot about things you never even liner about. Computers are a really good way to find jobs. The reason I say this is I remember when my dad didn't have a job for a while and didn't have any luck with the local stores. So one day hes on the computer any happen to stubble upon this really helping website called craigslist.com when he saw how many jobs there were he was a stonished. The next day he went and applied for the job and ended up getting it. Another reason why I say computers benifit our society is online dating. For alot of people it is hard for them to find that special someone. Who know they @MONTH1 be lacking in self confidence of what ever else computers are a good way to look people up they can chat in online chat rooms or even @CAPS3 they want use a web cam. Lastly computers teach you a lot about thing you would never even knew existed for example I remember when I was looking at this animal, and insects site and found out that the daddy long legs is the most deadly spider but they cant bite people only small animals that just amazed me because I hould have never thought that. In conclusion I hope you get why computers benifits our society they can help you @CAPS3 you have problems finding a job. They can also help you @CAPS3 your of lacking in self confidence but still have a companion and lastly they can teach you about thing you never knew about so please see why I believe computers better and benifits our society.",8
480,"Having a computer can cause you to go on everyday. But computers are very helpful @CAPS2 people can @CAPS1 work on them. People who have computers usually @CAPS1 work on them for their job or use them to keep in touch with family and friends. They can use them to look things up like look up times for a fight they can check the weather easily. The people that spend most of their time on their computer have been missing out on whats going on in the real world and they are probably not used to runing and get tired easily and they need to exercise and go outside more to get fresh air. Sometimes you have to put away the computer and go @CAPS1 something thats not virtual and have fun. Most people spend abot @NUM1 hour on the computer and then go @CAPS1 something else and the people who spend atmost @NUM2 hours are spycho @CAPS2 what is there to @CAPS1 on a computer far that long and they need to go and @CAPS1 something besides video games.

481,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, A computer has many effects of people, it helps a lot of people. There is lots of different things that come in handy with computers, like emails, printing, webchatt, cool web sites, and many more. Technology has benefited are society in some good ways and some bad way, such as communicating with others, but on the other hand computer give you to it for hours and hours at a time. There are many people on computers, and benefiting some. Also people are spending to much time on the computer home when getting act and exersizeing. There is many different benefits for a computer some @MONTH1 be bad or good. ",5
482,"Dear Local Newspaper, I think that computers have a positive effect of people. I think this because it can help relieve stress socialize, and help eye-cordination. The first reason I think computers have a positive effect on computers is then can help relieve stress. For example after a long day of work at a stressful place you wan't to go home and go on the computer. You can then play games which will relax your mind. The second reason why I think computers have a positive effect on people is that they help socialize. For example say I @NUM1 grade you met someone really special and then you had to move. Well on the internet there are social sites to meet friends you haven't seen in a while. The last reason why I think computers have a positive effect on people is that they can your hand-eye cordination skills. This skill can be very useful later in life with many jobs & tasks. Computers help for example by letting you play games that you need to follow and move past. I hope that the writers of this local newspaper use my letter in an article because it has good points that show computers do have a positive effect on people.",7
483,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern: @CAPS1 you enjoy going on the computer? I believe that being on the computer is very useful. First, being on the computer helps teach people hand-eye coordination. Second, the people can learn about different places and people. Lastly, anyone on the computer can talk to friends and family. Please read on to learn more. First and for most, being on the computer helps teach the people learn hand-eye coordination. By typing you need to know where your hands need to go so you well with the computer. This helps in life because if your trying to go and @CAPS1 a sport you need to knw wher your hands and/or feet have to go. Also, when your typing you should know where the keys are. This helps you because when your typing something for your boss or teacher it won't take forever to type it out. Next, you can learn about other places and people. If you were going on a trip you @MONTH1 a little bit about that place. Then you find places you want to visit country. Also, you can one person become famous. You couls use this info to write a work article. Further more talk to your friends and family. Sometimes people can't find specific phone numbers in the phonebook. Instead they could go on facebook, myspace, ect. And talk to them on the website that them to chat. Finally, some people can't hear so they can't talk on the phone. Instead they would be able to send emails back and forth. Can't you see the computer is useful? I teaches us hand-eye coordination. We can learn more about different places and people. Finally, we can keep in contact with friends and family. So it's now or never, should agree or disagree that computers are beneficial?",8
484,"Computers today have taken a toll on society. Using technology advancement has changed the world. Two out of four people are using a computer more then a hour a day. Which seems to be changing how we are evolving @CAPS1 a being. Some people are obsessed others just forget about nessary needs the body has. Computers should be taken down a knoch until we realize how to live with them without computers becomming our life. Young children, teens, and adults have seen effects of technology on love ones or just close friends. The century we are living in has become a new aera for technology advances. We have gotten hooked on not needing to think or use our brains, why would we when we have everything, all the answers two clicks away on google. Individuals don't see theirselves becomming obsessed, always wanting to be chating away on facebook or serching away for answers to homework. @NUM1 years ago they didnt have a easy way to get answers in life or communakate. people that become obsessed cant picture their life without computer games or facebook seights. Men and women turned out fine without computers. They worked hard and become full of knowledge that wasnt just given to them. Computure addiction has gone to such @CAPS1 high level that people forget about nessarities, like @CAPS2 and eating right. Being on twenty four seven notifies the mind to only think about what you want, and thats searching your life away. Computers dont move so the ocupier or the chair wont either you miss out on playing with your dog or jogging on the beach. Spending more and more time on the internet means less time outside and burning caliories that you consume until typing away @CAPS1 you become bigger and bigger the less you care about @CAPS2 and eating the correct way. Computers and deffinetly linked too obisity problems in the @LOCATION1. We all need a reality check on what our main priorities are. The effects of computers are going to demolish the @LOCATION1. Human beings are too dependent on what they believe computers can do for them. people cant have a normal conversation without bringing up computers or sieghts they have visited before. Dont you find it rude when your trying to talk to a friend and they are typing away at their phone that just got internet? I surely do. You cant ask somebody a question without a hold on... What did you just say. Internet is comming everywhere phones portiable laptops. We forget how to act when we talk because of computure slang and just being on. We even have on line dating services that bring people together because they dont meet people, because their on computers all day. We should change how we are evoling before its too late and people don't know how to talk to each other without using slang or having sunglasses with internet screens in side them. Changing our obsession could bring teen and child school grades up, more athlets in the world to compeat in the olimpic and chances for every being to become a better person. The computers advantages that we have @MONTH1 help us in ways now but distroy our @CAPS3, healthy, perspective on the earth. We need to stop becoming dependent.",10
485,"Dear @CAPS1 of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 I belive that computers are a help to our society and give us the upper hand on other countries, @CAPS4 example most countries around the world do not have a computer in eviry home our countrie has @NUM1 to @NUM2. Our countrie has a computer in @PERCENT1 of our homes that means we have a well educated populace, computers give insight to far away places that makes people want to travle and that can help our economy. When a middle aged man is on the computer bored, and sees a place like @CAPS5 he plans a trip with a computer, buys tickets with a computer, and then books a hotel with a computer. Those things cost money and the spending boost our economy. We do infact have a problem with obesety in our country but computers can help fix that. The computer game wil is montion inter active making the person dance, jump, play base ball, run a marathon, and many other sports you could also advertise gym memberships on the internet causing people to work out and lose weight. Please help the computer cause by going to this website at your conveinyence www.savethecomputers.org and fill out the free survey to keep computers in our homes.",7
486,"Dear @CAPS1 newpaper, @PERCENT1 of all @CAPS2 hve a computer in their houshold. What would it be like if all of them are as it and not with the outside world? Well, studys show that this is one of the main reasons that @CAPS3 are becoming unhealthy. People are concerned that we are spending to much time on the computer and less tme exercise, enjoying with family and friends. Computers are not needed and serve as a tords as @CAPS2. Less time exercising is a problem even without computers. There are so @MONTH1 now adays that a computer is just maky it worse. Likemore, this is a reason why @CAPS2 are going weight. Studies show that @CAPS6 are not exercising becuse @NUM1 mainly web games and computers. Therefore, Computers are something the we can what. Nature is an of the beautis of the world and computers are that away from us. For example: People think that the computer gives them information about nature but really they not for their selves. Make us somethg that not be seen in prison not an a computer. Family and friends is another problem with computers. People get addicted to and as a result, my dad interest with . Also, computers hav eveythg from games to e-mail that could be the for. Although, computers are able to contact friends and family members from across the world, thd wouldnt be the only reasn why they be on the computer. Its time to discide whay computer should be used or not. They as a towards @CAPS7 and part of the rasn why is are so unhalthy. I hope you see my at the",8
487,"Computers have evolved so much in the past twenty years. However, is that a good thing for the average @CAPS1? People using computers twenty four seven is a problem. They: rather use a computer then go outside they start relaying on them too much and people can easly get addicted. This can really have a affect on society when the computer goes sour. In @LOCATION1, the @DATE1 is such a great time. People start going outside more, the weather warms up which means that it is a great time to go outside. However, if people go on the computer constantly, now do you expect for them to be able to enjoy this great @DATE1 weather. The computer caused problems since when someone is about to go outside the computer drogs them in wanting them to use it more. That is when the inosent is droged by the computer, and when they rather use it then go outside. Now a days, so many things can be done on the computer just to avoid the store, as the bills. Computers are used to buy items at stores, pay bills, or even to get those tax refunes in. However, don't you believe that people are relaying on computer too much? How would the owner react if one day they were on the computer and it were to shut down. The person would loose it and not know what to do. They would now know how to take care of the problem. A lot of people use computers no only because they have to, but also for there enjoyment. There enjoyment however, can lead to on addiction which means never leaving the computer. An example is when a student comes home from school and decides to on the computer. Before you know it, the time has gone by and it is nightime with the student sill playing on the computer with homework to be completed. We @MONTH1 take advantage of computers sometimes, however they can cause problems. People would rather use them more they can have people relay on them more, and also people become addicted. These are the affects computers have on people.",8
488,"Dear Local @CAPS1, I think that computers do not benefits society. I think people be exercising more. They should also try interacting more with their family and friends, then with their computer. They could also be enjoying nature or helping their environment. So there are a lot of things you could be doing then playing on your computer. My first reason why i think computers do not benefit society is because people spend all their time on the computer that they do get out of the house and exercise. People have more fan on the computer that all they do is sit and eat. They don't do anything else. Then they do usally get unhealthy and gain weight. However, when they exercise they can get healthy. There are a lot of stuff you can do at the gym to get fit. For example, swimming or running. Sometimes in the gym when you do stuff like swimming or running they will have a tv in there. So you could watch tv or listen to your favorite music instead of being a lazy bum and playing on the computer all day long. If you dont like working out alone then you could bring your friend. You guys could play in the pool or play inside tennis. Or if you don't wanna go the gym just go out for a walk. Or go out jogging. There are a bunch of ways to get healthy and have fun, so your not on the computer all day long. Who knows you might just have more fun. So thats why i think exercising is better for you then playing on the computer all day long. My second reason is people could be interacting more with their family and friends then their computer. Somepeople spend so much time on the computer they forget whats going on in real life. For example, what their kids grades are. They could stop playing on the computer and go to the park with their family and friends. Just spending time with eachother would help their relationship with their family. They could learn alot about them. So just spending with you family and friends would be better then they computer. My third reason is instead of being on the computer they could start enjoying natore or help their environment. The environment could use all the help they could get. Animals are dieing because of us. We should stop cutting down their homes. We should rebuild them so stop going on the computers and actually try to help the environment? You could get your friends and family to help you. It would be great bonding but mostly good for the environment. Or you could go for a nice walk in the park and listen to the birds. Eiether way is good for you. So you should just try it. So those are my reasons why people should spend less time on the computers. You could be having more fun exercising. Or maybe you might have more fun interacting with family and friends. You could also try enjoying and repearing nature. There are a bunch of things you could be doing instead of being on the computer.",10
489,"Dear news editor, @CAPS1 you know that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 spend at least @NUM1 hours a day on there computer. I belive that computers are taking to much time in our daily lifes when we can be out doing sports, studing for school, or even spending time with our families. Sports are very important to everyone but not everybody do sports, thats what computers are doing. Computers make it hard for some people to go outside and get some fresh air. In the university of @CAPS3 they @CAPS1 a test conducting teenagers and how they spend there day. Its a fact that @PERCENT2 of students would rather go on the computer and chat with there friends instead of going outside a play a sport. This is very hard for teenagers to get out of something they really enjoy doing but sports also make you very fit and healthy. In one day of going outside you burn more calories then sitting at your computer going on facebook or twitter. Lastly sports get you united with other friends, peopld who play more sports usually tend to be more popular then a person that goes online all day. Sports are important for many different reasons like time wise, healthiness and friends but also the computer takes away your study time. Studing for school is very important when you are in your teenager years, school is the thing that gets you a job when your older, or lets you be whatever you want to be when you grow up. In the univirsity of @CAPS4 they conducted an expiriment that going on the computer for more then @NUM1 hours will decrease your grade average by @PERCENT3. Studing is what gets you through highschool then collage. Also when you are on the computer for so long you tend to forget the asignments that you were asighned for schoo. After all that you wont know what your learning about and fail most of your tests. Lastly, when your all done with highschool and you look at your grades and say ""wow, how @CAPS1 i get this"" You will know that all your computer chatting and playing computer games @CAPS1 this to you. What collage would want an @CAPS5, @CAPS6, @CAPS7 students in there univirsity. I wouldn't, studing is very important but one of the most important things in life is your family and spending time with them. Families are the things that unite kids to there parent, causing to there uncles. It makes the whole world happy, you dont want to get ride of that just because you want to go online and chat with your friends. Some kids get seperated from there families and never get to see them again and they would give anything to have there parents in there arms. And there are the people who have parents but don't appericate what they do for them. Do you want to turn out like those people just because of a computer? Computers take the ability of people to do what they want to because of there adicting games and online chats, but there are better things to do like sports, studing or spending time with your family. You can make a change.",10
490,"Dear @CAPS1 of the @CAPS2, I am very concerned about the effects which computers have on society. Computers have been very useful to us since the day it was invented. They have provided accurate and useful information throughout our daily lives. Computers helps us to view things we never knew existed. They help us to learn about cultures and different places, but just as computers serve a good use, they can also be a burden. Computers prevent people from socializing face to face. They prevent peole from getting their work done. Computers also cause an addiction to small children. These reasons account for the problem, that computers have a negative effect on a majority of people. Computers have a negative effect on a majority of people because it prevents them from socializing face to face. Teenagers especially tend to use the computer more than a cell phone or talking to someone face to face. This is because, on the phone they have a limit for how long they can talk or how many people they can talk to. Talking on the phone all night also raises their phone bill so they get in trouble with their parents. So they use the computer which they can use to talk to more than one person, they dont have a limit and they can stay up all night which is not good for their health. So it reinforces my statement saying computer have a negative affect on a majority of people. Computers have a negative affect on a majority of people because it prevents them from getting their work done. Some adults feel as if they do not have to go to the office to work. They can do the work at home on the computer. So eventually they get fired. Teenagers are busy on the computers talking or playing games, that they do not get their work done. The work is not done so they fail school. When they are older they donot have a good job because instead of doing their work, the spent their time on the computer. Computers are useful but they have a negative affect on a majority of people. Computer have a negative affect on a majority of people because it causes addiction. Many people do not pay attention at school because they were thinking about an awsome game they played or the conversation they had. Computers mostly cause an addiction to small children. Children easily get addicted because, while their brain is in a growing process, it implants the idea of going on the computer to play games on a daily basis. They get too use to using the computer that they do not know when to stop. So computers have a negative affect on a majority of people. In conclusion many adults should really think about the examples I have stated, especially parent. Children have to think about the future instead of wasting life on a computer. I am not saying children should not use computers, I am just saying there should be a limit. Don't you agree?",10
491,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am a student from @ORGANIZATION1, I am writing this letter to inform you of the effects of computers and how we benfit from them. I am for computers mostly because mostly because I can keep in touch with friends by using @CAPS3 and other websites. I would much rather use a phone to talk but since everyone always uses the internet and don't bother with a phone it seems to make more sence. Comuters are also very helpful for businesses because they store all their messages about private work and things that need to be worked on like graphs and other important business like problems. Using e-mail is a good way to get news and other fun games and youtube videos. A lot of people pay taxes online now and if you take internet acess away they lose a lot of important information. They might pay their taxes late because of that and if people are used to paying taxes online and all of a sudden they can't and they start doing it with physical paper in front of them, who knows they @MONTH1 have trouble and get very confused. I used the internet for e-mail, @CAPS3, occasionally games, and study @LOCATION1. I think study @LOCATION1 is important for becoming better at certain subjects or lessons. I had to do every study @LOCATION1 in the math section and I did not like it at all doing twenty four tests, but it helped me out with my grade and I'm glad I did it. Also for @ORGANIZATION1 if students have a project clue that involves colorful pictures a computer and colored printer would be very helpful. Also if students have an essay due typing it on microsoft word is a good way for it to be kneet and easily able to read. These were just a few resonds of why computers are good to have and how you can benefit from them.",8
492,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 is technology all aroud people every day, wether its a work, home, or out on your phones. About @PERCENT1 of people use computers daily. I believe this could have good, and bad effects on people, but mostly good. Effects, education and money run into each other on this subject and computers in my opinion are great! Moreover, I will begin with @CAPS2 effects. For example, my some really great things could happen on the computer with you and your friends while your on an online website, like facebook. People have the opportunity to meet people from all around the world, the only bad part is you have to absolutly know the person. Most of the time it will be one of your friends. On computers you have a great chance to talk to friends, or family. @CAPS1 are so many ways! Secondly, education is a great topic for this subject sometimes teachers ask students to go online to their website, to eather do homework or to do something online. Other times is to get pictures on @ORGANIZATION1, for kids projects. Like people say, ""everything happens for a reason."" @CAPS1 are many websites on the internet for everyone of all ages to get on to learn something. Some accually have wonderful information that everyone should know. Lastly, food is my last reason why computers are good for us. Well, first of all, everyones heard of weight loss programs on the internet and some really work. Others cost money, and others don't. Thus, talking about adults for this situation internet will be needed greatly sometimes. Another fantastic reason is razors. Some can be online also. And this is an awesome way to get bread, candy, ect. What would you do without the internet doing all these creative things? How about not helping with your work? or what are student and kids going to do when they need to know something? my opinion on the effects computers have on people are important facts to know and think about. Lets pay attention and realize that computers are good for us!",9
493,"Dear local Newspaper, I have been informed that you would like people to write letters of the effects of computers. I think computers have very good effects on people for the most part. In a recent study, @PERCENT1 of kids and adults had a good effect on computers. I think they allow us to learn new things, teach hand-eye coordination and allow us to connect with others. my first reason why I think computers have good efforts is because they allow us to learn new things. Theres so many sites that are appropriate and give valuable information. The older you get the more projects for school you have to do and without a computer it can be very difficult to learn about that certain project. Computers have so many sites and groups that give imformation and just sites that have learning games. My second reason is because they come with another good reason, when your doing all that typing your practicing hand eye coordination. You keep looking back and forth and your actually learning a skill that is very useful to life. Also when your typing your exercising your hands and working your muscles. learning hand eye coordination is good especially for sports; like baseball, tenis, softball, so learning it early can help you become a better sports player. Finally, my last reason is connection on computers. Over the years many of my closest friends have moved, but recently, I have been able to stay in touch with one because of resorting to the computer, now that we can talk we can share pictures and chat. Computers are very useful in that you can stay in touch with friends and family. If you use the sites appriatly you can connect and talk to friends, they allow you to involve yourself in friends lifes. Now adays they have many sites you can use and chat with others. Computers are very useful in that they have many advantages, they have many learning sites, to read and learn new things, they teach hand, eye coordination by typing and looking on the computer, and they allow you to chat or keep in touch with old friends, new ones and family. Its now or never, computers have way more pro's than con's, I think computers have many effects and are a very good invention and are great in everyday lives.",9
494,"Dear local newspaper, I think that computers do benefits society because if helps people to learn about places all over the world. People also became more sociable, there is classes online and if you have friends or family members that live for, far away from you, you can keep in contact coith them in many ways! My first reason why computers benefit our society is because it helps people to learn about places all over the word. If you go online you reasearch a name of a place and learn history all about it, this kind of websites also include photos. This information might help you for school work and even for publicity. One time I had a @CAPS1 studies project on china the internet helped me find information about history, religion, holldays, places to tour and spend vacation at. Because of the computer I had all the information I needed and got an A on my project. My second reason why computers beefits our society is because it help people become more so dable, for example if you have friends and family members that live on the other side of the world well guess what? you chat and sometimes spend time with them. When I say spend time with them I mean by webcam. Webcam is a device you connect to your computer and it's like a video camara, you just sit in front of if and watchers what you do. If you want to do this with a person the other person must have a webcam too. You can also chat online with people and send pictures to others through email. I have family members in @CAPS2-@CAPS3 that have computers too and I always communicate online with them and look at pictures of my family though they are not near me. It is really fun and you can't do this without an computer. My third reason why computers benefit our society is because some people don't have enough time to drive back and forth to colleges so, @CAPS4 take online classes. Online classes are just like school and you also pay for education just like any other college. I know this because my cousin graduated from high school but is working very hard to have enough money to buy a car that she can drive back and forth to college. She does not want to waste her fine looking and at home doing anything so she goes on her computer and take online college classes. If it wasn't for a computer she would not be learning and taking her education seriously. So, there you have it. Those are some reasons why I think computers benefit our society. with computers people are more sociable, You get education, You can keep in contact with friends and family members all over the world, no matter where they're at. Computers are very useful!",10
495,"@CAPS1 I just stay up for a couple more hours? I'm really busy and have a lot of homework! @CAPS2 all of the children around the world addicted to the computer. @CAPS5 these days spend about @NUM1 hours on the computer a day! Even though parents hear excuses that their children are working on homework, did you ever think what happens when you walk away? They minimize their essay, research and other homework and start chatting with their friend on @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and all of the other hundreds of websites that connect with your friends. As being the local newspaper it is your job to put an end to this computer addiction! It is shown by experts that @CAPS5 need more @CAPS6, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. First off, computersdefinitely do not benefit society because of the time it has taken away from peoples lives. Citizens of the world should be outside on the beautiful @DATE1 day, or the first snow of the winter, instead cooped inside their homes @CAPS6 has been locking all around the world and it is coused by our laziness. About @PERCENT1 of the world is overwheight which is @NUM1 out of every @NUM3 people. It is also one of the main reasons of death. Just by turning off the computer, people @CAPS1 enjoy the outdoors, run around with their neighbors, friends, and siblings and actually enjoy it. Why should people waste their time chatting with friends, when you could invite them over and play outside? That means, you are excercising, enjoying nature and having fun all at once! Secondly, computers have a lot of effects towards people because it takes time away from family and friends. In my experience, I would much rather want to go to the park with my family than play games on the computer. It also gives @CAPS5 a chance to interact more with their families which gives them more support. I have had a friend who started failing classes because problems with parents. If she spent less time on the computer and more time with family and friends, things would have been different. Lastly, having @CAPS5 spend less time on the computer, would bring those bills way down, and would a lot of energy. Also, if you really have to speak with your friends that lise far away, there's an invention called a telephone instead of talking for an hour on the computer, pick up the phone and call them. This way, your mom and dad @CAPS1 go on and pay bills or do work! The other reason why computers are unhealthy for society because of pressure in school. Teachers expect you to type essays, look up research. but how come we @CAPS1't hand write it? This way you will save energy and money, and you could always type it at school. For research, you @CAPS1 get a book such as an atlas or an encyclopedia. In conclusion, computers do not need to be in our lives anymore. Being the local newspaper, it is easy to spend the world around to abandoned using computers. This way, people will get more exercise, enjoy nature, spend time with family and friend and save money. As experts say computers @CAPS1 take away a whole year in an average lifetime! Just image...what could you do with an extra year?",10
496,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 much would our daily lives be affected if we didn't use computers? I feel that the use of computers greatly benefits our daily lives. Computers help us in many ways, including keeping in touch with far away friends. They also help alert people of up to the minute news. @CAPS7 you can see, Computers have many positive effects on our society. Have you ever had a friend move far away? Sure you could visit them every once in a while but computers help people keep in touch with one another. I know from experience @CAPS2 easy it is to keep in touch with someone. Using computers, one of my friends moved away last year and I am still constantly talking to her. Because of computers, we can email each other when get the chance and we still remain close friends, Other thing that are helpful computer are social networking sites. These @CAPS3, @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 help people to stay in touch with each other. for example, some of my friends still communicate with camp friends through those sites. They even helped them become closer friends. @CAPS7 you can see, Computers make it much easier to communicate with friends that live farther away. This aspect is one of the great benefits of computers on modern society. Another great impact computers have made on society is bringing news to people very quickly. Instead of having to wait for the weather report to come on television in the @TIME1. I just check the computer; @CAPS6 weather reports, computers also have reports or to news stories. @CAPS2 many have you been the news, waiting for and then you over twenty minutes, or wasting your time because the hasn't come on and it is time for you to go? I know that happened frequently to my mother. The problem was solved when I told her to look on the computer. Now, she doesnt waste her time waiting for the story to come on the @LOCATION1, computers also helped us find out about school delays or @CAPS7 you can see computers help people with things they do daily such @CAPS7 checking weather, finding out about top news stories, or hearing about @CAPS8 computers help people They can help to find out about weather or news; to keep in touch with an old friend. I understand the arguments that online communication can never sometimes it is very hard to get to see people in @CAPS9 @CAPS1 would agree that computers have greatly benefit our day to day lives our lives would be much without the use of computers, @CAPS7 you can see computers better our lives on a @CAPS10 of ways.",10
497,"Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2, The computer is perhaps, on of the most enterprising inventions. They broaden horizons for children eager to learn and make communication much more sufficient. Furthermore, computers encourage the development in had eye coordination for people of all ages. Withought adoubt, computers are not only a major attribute to the successes of people all around the world, they are the solution, and they will and should forever be part of our growing culture. It is important to note that computers provide a learning environment, for children and adults, teenagers and grandparents. Before the invention of computers, to write a paper, one would need to goto the library. Now, right in your own home, you can access trillions of website for more information than a library could every provide. Additionally, computers enable people to learn and understand culture goverments and people around the world. Whether you want to learn about religion, or the rules of soccer, the internet is your gate to new discoveries. It is also important to note, by having access to computer people will be able to learn about you, and perhaps be introduced to your product. People can now read books on line and they can learn different languages. The possibilities are endless. As I mentioned, computers even allow people to talk online with other people. Facebook, twitter, instant message, and email are allways to communicate with friends co-workers or family. More recently, computers now are capable of showing alive feed from person to person . This enables people to not only talk but virtually be with that person. Also, computers are home to many software programs in which you can meet perhaps the love of your life. Onsight such as eharmony, you can communicate with people who share similar intrests as you make a bond to last a lifetime. Equally as important, computers encourage the development of fine motorskills. Obviously, typing is a challenging process for many that requires practice, building up hand eye cooordination. By typing you strengthen your fingers and increase your endurance. On the otherhand , some educational computer games also build up hand eye coordination for people of all ages. Although some critics say that computers take the place of interacting with family and friends, it is evident that computers incourage communication with relatives and people around the world, via eharmony or facebook. As a whole, computers are positive to our growing and enterprising culture. the time has come to tell the world really how vital they are to everyone. They provide an adequete place for learning for people of all ages and enable people to communicate with others more quickly and easily. The development of computers also help to build the strength of fingers, and also hand eye-coordination, Are you going to surpass this chance we have for great success? Everyone knows that computers @MONTH1 be a distraction but the are what best for our future. They play a big role in the development and success of our society.",11

Well computer are a great resource for learning. With the power of the internet you can learn about places all around the world with the click of a button. Maybe people are using computers too much and are not getting the only exercise they need but really, computers are a very reliable resource to learn from. Computers help many people in many different ways. You can explore different parts of the world in a computer you can also learn a new language on a computer Computers are so high and these days that you can practically learn anything you want off of a computer. Having computers in school makes it even easier to learn because they are musch faster than turning pages through a five hundred paged text book. Technology these days can truly change peoples lives there love, having computers is a good thing. If you ever need to tell your friend something but they are on the other side of the world, you can send them an e-mail. This helps many people reach others much faster.

Computers can change people lives forever, computers can help you meet new people and also make you wait to create a computer of your own. Overall, computers can change peoples lives and make people much more aware of what is going on in the world. Although computers are quite amazing things, unfortunately they do take away a lot of time from your normal life. Parents often put a limit on computer use if you are on the computer too often or if you can't seem to get off with the technology these days, you can't seem to get off at the electronics. Computers are very fun to use daily but try not to get lost in the world of computers. The main time computers take away from a persons life is exercise time. If you do not play a sport, then it is even harder to get off of the chair and go exercise for at least thirty minutes. This is one of the things that are causing people to be more overweight than usual. Although computers are great, they are adictive and can change your life for the worse. In the end, computers are an advanced technology that make peoples lives much easier. But, they can change your lives for the worse. In the end, computers are an advances technology that make people lives much easier. But, they can change your lives for the worse depending on how you use it. Computers are a great way to learn and eventualy are going to change the world, hopefully for the good and not the bad.",9
499,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 out of ten people use computers every day. That’s why I strongly agree with this satement: That people are spending to much time on the computer. One, people aren't interacting with family and friends, people are obessed about computer and people getting overweight. On many laptops and computer there are @CAPS2 (you can buy them in the stores too.) @CAPS2 are fun loot, however instead of walking to your friends house you just type with them. Interacting with family and friends face to face not with a computer in between is better. For example, @PERSON2 has a webcam on her computer and she talks with @PERSON1. Who @PERSON2 could just walk down the street to talk too. Do you notice your kids not interacting with you, newspaper readers? When you walk by your kids computer do you see them switching the. The page that they don't let you see is, @CAPS3 or myspace. People are getting @CAPS3 or land myspace accounts when they are as young as @NUM1 years old. For example, when @PERSON2 got a @CAPS3 I would see her on. Therefore she is addicted to the computer. When I was over her house, readers, she would always be on the computer. Now I never go over her house because thats all she would do. People are getting addicted to social networking on the computers. Have you, local newspaper, notice after you made an account on the computer you gained some weight? I have notice my friend @PERSON2 has. When you came home from work or school you find you selve getting chips and the computer? I even sometimes do that but not everyday. Moreover people rather go on the computer than go for a sun. No wonder why they call @CAPS6 one of the fatest countries. As you can see, Readers, computers are taking over our lifes. People aren't being socail without a computer, adults and kids cure getting obessed with computers. Moreover, people are getting over weight and not exercising. Americans, we need to a stop to these.",9
500,"Dear Local Newspaper, I think the amount of time people spend using the computer is just fine. I think this because even though people do use the computer, it is a great way to learn about faraway places and their cultures. It also teaches hand-eye coordination and allows people to talk online with each other. In this every, I will explain the benefits of using computers. The first benefits, as I about is that the computer will allow people to learn about faraway places and other cultures. @CAPS1 example, if I wanted to learn about @LOCATION1, I could just type up the word @LOCATION1 on google, and link to at things. Which opposes to having to find a book or even going to the library just to find one book on it. And did you know that @PERCENT1 of all computer technicians @CAPS2 that it is quicker to look things up on the internet then look things up in a book? that is @CAPS3 first reason. @CAPS3 second reason is hand-eye coordination. This would help in sports, @CAPS1 example, if you are playing football, you would be able to track where are ball is going and catch it than someone who doesn't use the computer as much. Hand -eye coordination also helps because in you get into you are able to throw and block punches quicker. Keep reading on to see @CAPS3 third and find argument. @CAPS3 third and final reason is that you are able to talk with people all across the world. @CAPS1 example, @CAPS2 you have an who has to go to @LOCATION2 @CAPS1 a year. You would be able to talk to her using @ORGANIZATION1 or video chat. That way you can keep in touch with loved ones even they are away. So @CAPS3 there reason why computers are good is because you are able to learn about far away places and cultures, @CAPS3 second reason is that using a computers can hand-eye coordination. And @CAPS3 third and final reason is that you are able to talk to loved ones even though they @MONTH1 be far away. So I think computers should be to be used as much as they do today.",8
501,"Dear Local Newspaper, I want to explain how computers affects people lives, one is that it can give your important information, two you can out an more important things in life, and three you can learn about different culture and languages. My first reason why I want to explain how computer affects people. You can learn important information for instins you can look up a biography for a writing test or thing you just want to be aware of, you are intrest in. My second reason is you can out on more important things in life like family and communicating with them & having fun go outside for some fresh air once in a while and stop playing video games on the computer. My third reason why computers can affect a person life is that you can learn different cultures and language like getting information on your ancestors and how they live their lifes and what are their traditions, languages because if you want a specific job that requires a certain language you can search website that can teach you. I choose the three reasons because their are times when you can look information up and other times when you spend quality time with family and friends, and last look up your past lives like your ancestors.",7
502,"Dear, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 you know over @NUM1 million people use a computer? The reason why people use computers is for a few reasons. Weather it is their @CAPS4, hobby, or their buisness. The computer is a fascinating piece of technology. But Other people believe computers can ruin lifes. Or make people @CAPS5-@CAPS6. So the question everyone is asking is @CAPS7 computers be used as much as they are. Almost every one in @LOCATION1 has a computer. But many people who love new gaddets and technology somtimes forget that health comes first. @CAPS3 you know that @LOCATION1 is one of the least healthy countries on the earth? @ORGANIZATION1 says that computers are an active contributer to americas bad health. Computers were originaly made to make everyday tasks easier. But in my opinion it makes it harder because people are always glued to their computer. What are computers really used for today? The first thing people think of when they hear the word computer is internet. The internet is the main reason people are so glued to their computer. This is because people can always find some kind of new website. Their are billions of websites now its not even funny. The internet is probably the main cause of kids wanting to stay inside instead of exploring and having fun outside. If you are a parent do you want the best for your child? If so you @CAPS7 tell them all the basic necesities that a human needs in order to survive. For example tell them they need exersize, healthy foods, clean water, and shelter. Also tell them about when you were a child and might not have had a computer. This could be a huge step toward in our countries/world health. Not only for the world but also for all your friends and family. So now its time to decide the fate of @LOCATION1. @CAPS7 we be idolized or be shuned upon. I think the decision is clear. So if you really want to start making people of all ages become better people what you can do. If you go to your friends/family and tell them they are on the computer to much they will listen to you if they care about you. If every one in the world does this we might just fix all bud things having to do with this generation.",9
503,"Dear @CAPS1 post, I think computers have a good effect on people and thier safty. Computers are a wounderful technology to have, espechaly with a wed cam. Computers are also easyer for school projects. Last but not least, computers are used in our military to keep us safe. Putting a web cam on a computer is an exanlant idea. A douter and son can see his or her dad thats been away on a busisness trip for mounthys or maybe evan years. An example in my life that a web cam came in handy was when my friend had a forien exchanged student from @LOCATION1 come to his house for a year. He was able to talk to his parents anytime he wanted to. He also got to introduce his parents to the people he was living with. Computers are a easy to look up information for school. For example, I forgot to read a book and do a project on, but I forgot to read the book and the project was do in @NUM1 days. What do I do? You can google a summary of the book and all you need to know is right thier. Computers are also good for making your work neeter, and you can print pictures and use that for your work. Computer make the military more safe. Insted of putting solders on the frount line you can have them controll a @ORGANIZATION1 preditor. A @ORGANIZATION1 preditor is a computer controlled plane shoots a computer controlled missilels were our enemys are hiding. Computers lets us know if there is an enemy country trying to invade our country, and about @PERCENT1 of our military and army are made up of computers. Computers are a big important technology in our country. Ya maybe kids are playing computer games then getting exsersize. Computer games slow up the computer anyway, and parent have to put a limmit to the games to. So my three reasons; talking to family, school work, and military and army benifits. State why I think computers are good not bad for our country in the @LOCATION2 And I hope you think the same way.",8
504,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you were around the age of @NUM1 did you have a computer? Or did you have to go to the library to use the computer? Computers have an effect on people both in a positive and negative. Personally, I think computers help with learning and interacting with people. But, there are people that disagree, with me, and think computers can cause health problems. The issue is, are computers good or bad for people. Read on to see why think computers have a good effect on people. School is one of those places where in can be fun but also can be boring. Learning has to do a lot with our future. Computers make it very easy for us. My school books are very heavy, and big. Sometimes if I have a lot of homework I don't take them home. Instead, I will go on the computer and research my topic. Now and days we rely on computers a lot. ""@CAPS1 teachers need worksheets they will go on the computer and print something out."" @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1. So you see it is not only me that thinks computers help with school. We also do projects on them. Growing up did you have a lot of friends or were you the person in the corner. Today, there are so many chatrooms. For example, @ORGANIZATION2, @ORGANIZATION3, @LOCATION1, etc. You can go on these and interact with other people. Facebook and @CAPS4 let you and friends. You can talk to them and @CAPS1 you go to school you will have something to talk to them about. The computer lets you join chat rooms in which you will meet new people. You can talk to someone across the world too. My cousin has a computer pal. A computer pal is @CAPS1 you are a type of older brother or sister to somebody. This person is across the world from you.. You don't see them in person. The computer can teach you how not to be shy and helps you interact with new people. You've heard the up side of computers but now its time for you to hear the down side. Many people belive computers can cause health problems. Computers also lets you play games. Which can cause lazziness. I was watching @CAPS5. They were talking about kids that use the computer for @NUM2 hours playing games. Now they play proffinal computer games. Those people @CAPS3 they have depression so games make them feel better. All the people on the show wear glass. Most of the people were fat. They stop exercising because they don't want to stop playing their game. Would you want your kids to damage their health. The time has come. It's now or never. What is your opinion? What time of effect to computers have. Personally, I think computers have a positive effect. Computers are a good way to interact with people. Studies show over @PERCENT1 say it helps with learning. Or are you against my opinion? Computers can cause lazziness and serious health problems. Your child can become overweight by not getting exercise.",10
505,"Did you think the computers are necessary for us? Many people think the is not necessary have a computer in the house, but other people think the is necessary have a computer in the house. Three reasons, first some kids have home work to do they need to find information or pictures. Second the people need to do work like type a information for the work. Last if we don't have computers we can communicate with - they family of other contry. Sometimes the teachers give homework to find information for a home work. The teachers say the somtimes we need the information for class work if they don't finish they can find the information agen so the kids need a computer. Sometimes the kids whant to have a picture for paint or draw. In a fabric need informetion for how many the workers are mead of fabric. They need to type the informetion for too know how many they need to pay to the workers. They need to type a letter for others persons. Persons like us have familys in other countries. Sometime they whant to talk but they don't have cellphone or a phone. They use the webcam to talk for the webcam can see aech others. The conclushion is the people need a computer for a good no bad. I think this speech work in something to you. Thanks you.",8
506,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 I think, this whole idea with us people being on the computer too much is kind of dumb. Being on the computer way too long can blind you. If, you choose to start to spend more time with the computer more than you spend time with your family and friends they'll probably start noticing it. lastly, that also can make you gain weight. Being on the computer can make you loose your eyesight because, basicly its like your looking at a light for atleast three or more hours and usually when your looking at a light or something bright you start to loose your eyesight. It doesn't help you at all. Especially, if you already wear glasses and have horrible eyesight. Another thing is that a lot of others start to use the computer more than they spend time with there loved ones. I think thats pretty bad if your starting to forget about your own family and friends. the people that care about you, because that can turn into something really bad. They start to think that your trying to avoid one another. That's not to good for anyone. Also, when you sit on the computer for a long time and eat and play or read whatever's on the screen. That's basicly gaining weight. Your eating and not even working it off. That's real bad for your health too! I, rather us eat then exercise. I, hope you took my opinions into consideration, and you use them in a positive way! Thank you for listening.",8
507,"Computers can be really useful if you know how to use them. Instead of sacrificing your social life for your computer, you can use it to improve your social life. You can use social networking websites like @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 to communicate with your friends and family instantly. You can even download instant messengers to instantly send text messages to your friends or familys' computers. Also, without research people wouldn't live as easily and possibly less healthier if they use the internet to consult online health experts regarding their health. Some people @MONTH1 over-use their computers and ignore socializing which is not good nor is it healthy. But instead of paying attention to the negative effects of computers, we should recognize the positive ones.",6
508,"Dear local newspaper, The effects computers have on people is not exeptable. The effect make it bad for people. Also, the effect of computer bad for children and kids. The computer could also lead to not healthy body. There for the effect of computer on people isn't great. First, many effect on peolefrom computer is bad for them. The computer make people go blind and that really bad. If everyone goes blind then know will we discover new things and cook food. Another reason is that going blind could waste a lot of money for glasses and there about @NUM1! Many family can't afford glasses that make their children can't see! Another way computer has bad effect on people is that their body isn't right. Most people who uses computer everyday and don't excersie are fat. This is bad for your health. For example, I have a grandma who stays on bed and watch @CAPS1 every day. This is like usingthe computer. It turn out that her blood pressure was high since she don't move. It causes her to have stroke and now she in a nursing home. As we can see this could happen to people who uses computer everytime of their lives. Another way it bad for your body is because will spend less time with family number. Spending less time with family will make relationship of one another just break apart. For example, I have a dad who always go to friend house and newer spend time with me and my sis. So my dad and I don't really get along. So that why using computer bad for your health. Therefore, computer is bad for everyone. Next computer effect one bad for little kids. There bad because now website has ad that show someone naked or something not appropriate. As the parents can see this is bad for children who don't know anything nad start talking aobut it in school. Also sometimes computer show bad word and soon those kids who see it will learn the word and start to swear. A memory I had is that one day I was on the ocmputer and saw bad word and ever a lady in a bikini. As you can see I was very affonded by sseeing that. I was confused, another reason computer effect kids i because lots of the website give flase information aobut website a child went on to search sometimes it should give a child a incorrect information. One day I wnent on wikipedia and search panda. It said that the panda was blue. And we know it not right but the children don't know that. There, computer have a bad effect on children. Last but not least, computer effect is ad for people health. For example, I have a friend who eat junk food, while on the ocmputer doing something everyday. this was bad for her health. It turn out she had to go to the doctor for eating to much junk, see!! The computer mader has not exercise reusing her to be in a unhealthy situation. Also, most people would sit and look at the computer. This is bad for everyone blood pressure. Expecially when we eating and sitting. This could cause all of have high colesteo. another reason istant no one will excercise making you body fat and won't decrease fat cell. As we can see it bad for everyone health. Therefore, computer is bad for you. In conclusion, computer effect are bad for people and should be step. Since, it not good for everybody by not talking to family. Also computer effect is bad for little kid, since the bad ad. And last it always bad for your health. Thus, people should only use computer if needed.",11
509,"Dear, Newspaper I think that computers are a good thing because you can talk to friends and family online. Also, I think Computers are a good thing because you can look up homework on it. Last, I think computers are a good thing because your hand-eye coordination will increase. Let's explore why I think it's good to talk to family and friends over the computer. First, because you can chat on aim and have a conversation. Also, you talk on facebook to see what your friends interested in and what they look like. Last, I think it's a good thing because you can also video chat to see how much older a family member is getting and just to make it feel like your talking to them right there if they far apart. Let's @CAPS1 why I think its good looking up homework. First, I think it's good for looking up home work because you can go on google or another site to look up something you don't understand or cause that's the only place to get the answer. Also, I think the computer is good for homework because if you left it in school you can get it off edline a school website that teachers post homework on. Last, I think that the computer is good for homework because for say math homework you don't have a calculator you can use the one on your desktop and if your computer dosen't have it you can type the math question in on google and it will give you the answer. Let's find out why I think that it will increase you hand-eye coordinaton skills. First, I think this because you typing will increase because you will wanna type quicker and you will start to know were all the keys are. Also, I think it would increase because if you play a sport your using hand-eye coordination. Last, it would increase because if you sit there typing and typing you will just get better. Now that's why I think computers are good and not bad for you. So I hope you take my ideas into consideration.",8
510,"Dear @CAPS1-in-@CAPS2, More and more people today are using computers. They are making our lives better and easier, giving us a lifestyle that our ancestors couldn't of dreamed of. Computers make our world a better place. The society of mankind has always been social one. We @CAPS4 human beings have the need to be around and know about our friends and family. With computers, this has become drastically simpler and easier. Facebook, founded by @NUM1 years old @PERSON2 for the students of @ORGANIZATION1, is a site that allows not only communications, but true connection. A recent article in the @ORGANIZATION2 stated that @PERCENT1 of people in @LOCATION2 had a facebook account. This is an incredible amount of people and because of this, not only kids but adults can connect with old friends that they don't know about. You never know, that third grade friend of your's might be the newest billionare. Let's say you did connect with an old friend on facebook, how would you communicate? With another invention that has changed our world forever, @CAPS3. Why send that message via ""snail mail"" when you easily have it sent and recieved in minutes. @PERSON1, a small buisness owner, recently stated, ""@CAPS3 allows met to connect with my customers, I can talk to them and get feed back on my products."" @CAPS4 you can see, @CAPS3 has helped @PERSON3 tremendously, @CAPS4 it does the rest of the world, even kids. But if your young, you might want something even better and faster than @CAPS3. What is this, you ask? Kids today can connect with each other over instant messaging, more commonly known @CAPS4 @CAPS5. @PERCENT2 of kids between the ages of @NUM2 and @NUM1 talk to each other over istant messaging. This allows them to chat and communicate, a proven thing to help kids develop socially, according to the medical examiner through all those advances computers help us to ""get connected"". For a moment, lets forget social networking, and get to something a touch more serious, buisness. The world revolves around money and buisness, just look around you. Most buisness run on computers, all of their records and information is all in computers. Remember those days when you would ""punch in"" a time card, well not anymore. These days you would swipe your key card through a scanner. Not only small buisnesses, but the biggest buisnes in the world is run by computers. The stock market is managed and dictated through computers. In fact, @PERCENT3 of investors buy their stocks online, on sites such @CAPS4 @ORGANIZATION3. And where do people get this money? It all comes from the banks. Online, people can manage their accounts or see if they can afford that @ORGANIZATION2 car. If you look at it mathmatically. According to the transition property. If computers run buisnesses in the world, the computers in the world. Through all of this, people need to know things. And the easiest way to do that is online. You can even get your daily news online, almost @PERCENT4 of news companies have websites, so you can check out the weather in @LOCATION3, or what just happened in the olympics. It is possible to go to @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION2.com and check out what is going on the world. Its not only news thats online, it's everything. Through search engine such @CAPS4 @ORGANIZATION4, one can find anything and everyone. Rose of the hospital for special surgery stated, ""I was about to perform surgery on a young man. I noticed a small if the bone marrow, so I googled it and saw it was a prelude to cancer"" This @ORGANIZATION4 result @MONTH1 men's life! We can also look back in history, @PERCENT5 of history is online, and anyone can access it. Through these advances, we have made human smarter. Computers have changed our world, we a the technology age an ages I am happy to be a part of. Computers make a world a better place.",12
511,"Dear our local Newspaper, I support the advances in technology in our town. Having the modern computers around are easily a benefit to society. The computer allows everyone to communicate with family, friends, or people from your business. They can be used for local news, weather, and/or sports scores from a big game you didn't get to watch. Last, they can be used to research anything anyone would ever want to know. Computers and modern advances in technology, can allow our community to talk and write to people all over the world. Wether it is to talk with a friend to ask about a homework question, to talk about a business, or if you have a relative that, for example, went to the war and doesnt have a cell phone, you can find plenty of ways to communicate over the internet. Today there are plenty of different sources to talk to people with. There are @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @ORGANIZATION1 and lots of others.

Two, open up the internet, and three type in whatever you are looking for and you will be surprised what you can find. You were wondering why the modern computer benefits our society and well, now you know.",9
512,"Dear @CAPS1. Do you thin that computers are good to the society. Fist a computer is a faster way of doing reaserch. Second the computers reach hand-eye cordination. It alows people to contact each other. A computer is a faster way or doing reaserch. I has a science project, and with one website I had the hole info. I also use my computer to type my homework and email it to the teachers. I also have microseft word , wich is a easier way to stady from my slife show. As you can see a computer can make my life easier. Second, computers reach hand-eye cordination. I know because I contact the mause with my hand but I dont look at it. I have a @NUM1 and I was asking my self how do I. Use a control with out looking at it. hand-eye is like multy task. Some times I say to my self if we learned to hand eye imagine in the future. Third it alows us to contact others. My laptop has a webcam so every @DATE1 we see my my sister. The webcam is an easy way to talk and see others. You can also see other people with skype or @ORGANIZATION1. As a result it turns out to be good. As you can see these are my reasons. Faster way or reaserch. It teaches hand-eye cordinations. It alows you to contact anione on the planet. As you can see a computer is a must have.",7

Computers can help to keep everything you do, neat and organized. A computers hard-drive is like having a large file cabinet full of everything you need. Furthermore, the @CAPS2 helps people do financial work. Many websites have been made to help people do bills, keep tack of money, and keep their identities safe.

514,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 society with active fit neighbors who don’t sit at home and play on the computer for hours. Taking away computers in our society will help the health and saftey of out people. I demand you to make this choose. Its important for our health. We shouldn't be staring at a computer for too long like most of us. We should be going for a jog or to the gym not sitting staring at a screen. My cousin @PERSON2 from @LOCATION3 was obese. She use to spend @NUM1 hours on the computer each day. Soon she realized she was @NUM2 pounds. She stop playing the computer and started to join a gym. Now, she is @NUM3 pounds and didn't go on her computer since then. Therefore, computers do affect your weight. Also, computers affect you vision. @PERSON2, eye doctor from @LOCATION2, says more people are going blind because they use the computer to much. @PERCENT1 of her patients have contacts or glasses. Don't forget! Even a simple move of a mouse is a health risk. I took a survey of @NUM4 different doctors. They all said many people are getting carbol tunnel from the motion of moving a mouse. Computers are a health hazard to @NUM5's of people. Computers affect the saftey of many people. You never know who is on the other computer. My friend @PERSON4 from @LOCATION4 was on the computer talking to her best friends @PERSON3. @PERSON3 said he didn't want to be friends any more. She asked him in school the next day if it was true and @PERSON3 was confused and didn't know what she was talking about. Their are hackers in the world. @NUM6 out of @NUM5 people get hacked or cond each day. If you don't want to listen to me then listen to @PERSON1, police officer from @LOCATION1, says their are more computer crimes then any other crime in are whole state. Computers aren't the safest way to communicate. Its suprising we haven't got rid off computers already. I does affect the health and saftey of the people in our town. I implore you to take away for these reasons.",9
515,"Crunch! That is the sound of another kid eating chips while on the computer. More and more kids are becoming overweight because of techknoledgy. Especially computers. People are spending time inside, not exercising. They will stay in their room and become loners too. The last and perhaps most important problem with computers is that they take away our chances to learn. We need to stop this virus of computers now before we are all taken over! Don't you just love to go for a nice run or jog? I do, but now, kids would rather stay inside and play computer games. The number of overweight people in @LOCATION1 have increased a lot since we all had computers. I can remember when I used to spend almost my whole life on the computer it broke down and i had nothing to do, so I started to work out. I lost @NUM1 pounds in one month! Do you see how much better our lives would be without computers. The deaths from sickness do to weight would plummit to almost none. We need to stop using computers so many teens just look themselves away in their room. They stay on the computers and just forget the world around them. They will throw away their whole social life, just to talk to random people on the computer. There are many child abductions in the world to the computer. They meet some stranger online in a chatroom and then they decide to meet in person the next thing you know, the mom is crying and her son/daughter is nowhere to be found. Do you really want this to happen to your child? And this is just one of many problems with computers. When a teacher assigns a book report no one actually does it. They just go on the computer and print one off. This is not going to help us learn. It does the exact opposite of that instead of students actually reading, they just find a quick summary of the book online. If parents want their kids to do well in life, then throw out their computer. Let your kids do work for themselves. I know that from what you just read you can tell that computers have negative effects on people they make us unhealthy, and drive us away from other, we have an easy life because of computers but is it a better one? Computers are bad for us, and now you can see that.",9
516,"Dear local newspaper, I have heard some peoples opinion’s about computers some say that when people spend time on the computers they spend less time on other things, then I heard that spending time on the computer gives the ability to learn more. Please heed my advice. I agree that computer’s benefit society. First of all, using the computer saves money. For ex. You want to look up book’s to study or read, you can look it up on the computer, then read it online, instead of buying them. You can also watch movies and listen to @CAPS1 on the computer instead of buying them, statistics say that the average people who use the computer, save about half as much as they spend the percentage is @PERCENT1 save @PERCENT2 doesn’t. Computers help in lots of ways, it helps with assignment for school to look more presentable and educated for class, you'll also look prepared. Computers help with presentations for school and for your jobs. I remember when I got my computer I began to know more about technology and things I never knew before, I did presentations using @CAPS2 @CAPS3 I also did math games online to help me with math. Then, two average boys who shared there there names @ORGANIZATION1 there both around @NUM1 the age teens go crazy on technology, @CAPS4 @PERSON2 say’s, “computer’s give people the ability to learn more and learn about different things”. Then @PERSON1 say, “spending too much time on computers take time away from exercise and enjoying nature.” In conclusion, I would like to say that now that you have heard two different opinions including mine that you have more of a better stated opinion.",8
517,"Dear Local Newspaper, The truth is computers have a negative effect on people. First of all, people spend too much time on the computer and forget that they have a real @CAPS6. Millions of people create unhealthy relationships with people they might not even know. Harvard studies show that @PERCENT1 of teenagers have ""friends"" that they only ever talk to on the computer. Some people even get so addicted they forget how to behave & interact with others. For example, @PERSON1 of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 once said, ""@PERCENT2 of kids who own a computer, don't have many friends because they have forgotten the appropriate way to act. Another thing is, spending so much time on the computer is an unhealthy decision. Once you make it, you don't have another option. Although there is so much information on the internet, it's not the best way to learn it. First of all, it takes the joy out of learning. Wouldn't you rather go swimming than look up if humans are less dense than water? According to a @CAPS4 study, @PERCENT3 of children & adults can absorb more information if they learn it hands on. You can think of a computer like potato chips. Once you experience it once, you just can't stop. If you're always on the computer, there's always another way of doing the same on the computer. Some people will argue you can learn hand-eye coordination by using the computer. In the end, computers don't make you happy, so why not learn the skill by playing tennis or piano? Also, if you're a parent that is always on the internet, you're setting a bad example for your children by giving them the message of being lazy & don't do anything with your lives. By being active a @ORGANIZATION1 study shows that you will be more likely to pick an apple as a snack then a chocolate bar because you want to feel good about yourself. It is important for our community that we raise children with a good, succesful background that know how to interact & cooperate with others. Lastly, the only thing the computer is good at is spending all of your money. In a highschool student poll, most children would choose a free way of hanging out with friends than having to spend money & repairs to video chat. With computers, you don't get the full effect of anything you do, & they even make you pay for it. Also, it becomes a competition of who's got the most up-to-date technology which is another bad habit to get into. Oprah @CAPS5 once said, ""@CAPS6 is a way better bargain than a computer."" @CAPS7, computers have a negative effect on all people of size, color, & age. they don't let you live the full, healthy, care-free, joy as @CAPS6 you are supposed to have a choice to have.",10
518,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I believe that the use of computers is out of control. If people keep on letting the computer take over their life, then pretty soon you wont remember how to talk to people in person, wich is just one way that computers are changing people. In no time at all people will be so consumed with being on their computers that america will become more obsess then we already are last, computers are a recourse to do work and research, if we are using them for other things we could be in a bit of trouble. It is shown in recent research that @PERCENT1 of americans use online sites. If this keeps going on through the computer then in no time at all people would be extremly unsociable because that forgot hour to talk to people in person. Without their computers they don't have time to think about what they are going to say next, this will lead to a very awkward situation wich no one enjoys. Instead of being on a dating sit then for you could go out with your friends and have a good time and meet people, wich I personly think a person I dont even know who they are. Imagine, its a beautiful day you are about to up your dog and go for a jog in the park but then uou hear the all to ""you got mail"". You forget about your dog and the jog and go over to your computer to check out you emailed you this could lead to a very unhealthy habbit that we cant afford. America is already clasified so over weight, so do you think instead of going out on a nice day, that you are huncher over at your desk typing on a computer, soon our country will have a major issue, so set off of that computer and go outside! Im not saying that compiuter amt a greta recourse to look up information on but that is all they should be used. If everyone used computers for only work then there would be no longer issue at all, but that far from happining. I think people should only be to use computers for work and education purposes, wouldn't that be the day. Now I hope you relize how computers are affecting people by making them home and be less not going out to nexercise and not uses them for only. I hope you listen to my reasons and use your computers more now!",9
519,"In my opinion I think people spend more time on the computer when they could be outside enjoying nature with friends and family. Therefore I think that most experts are right people should get off the computer and get outside. The three reasons that support my decision are people health less bonding time with others and that a computer screen can hurt your eyes in the long run. The health of people these days is going down more people are becoming obese and some of the reason is the @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS1 screens they are sitting behind inside. Studies have shown @PERCENT1 of obese people are on the computer for more the @NUM1 hours in one day. When I feel when there is nothing to do you could go outside play a sport take a walk. there are so many things to do outside and it makes me think why people don't go out and enjoy it! Some people use the excuse of its winter so I can't go outside but you can go outside all year-round. My second reason is you can bond with friends and family. I would rather talk to someone face-to-face than on @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 messager. When you sit on the computer you won't get to talk or see anyone and you will lose social skill from just talking to people on @CAPS2. You might never want to get off the computer but think about it you would be able to hang out with them at cinerom or fuzion zone. My third reason is using a computer can hurt your eyesight in the long run. Staring at that bright screen for a while espically everyday can put a strace on your eyes and can make your eye sight go bad. Computers aren't helping you they are actually hurting you. So if you want good eyesight get of the computer and get into exercise and the beauty of nature. In conclusion if you want to be a friendly fun to talk to, skinny person with great eye sight hop out of those computer chairs and into nature. The choice is up to you.",8
520,"Dear Local Newspaper, I am writing to you today to discuss computers having a problem with human nature. Meaning, many people not going outside for fresh air or not exercising. A question that goes through my head is, ""do computers give knowledge?"" @CAPS1 that I mean do people get smarter when on the internet because people have a chance to read on learn new things like new words. People say that @CAPS2, @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 has interfered with school work and dont get it done, but kids when on the internet get to talk friends and family is useful. Computers have advanced our technology and @MONTH1 bring it to the next level. In my own opinion computers aren't interfering with exercising or enjoying nature because people see creative ideas to do in nature for example, when people are ""bored"" they @MONTH1 go on youtube to maybe find something to do just to got the brains pumping and discover new things. Usually people have been becoming addicted to the internet and wont let up, because the internet is basicly a virtual world and make us really creative like I said before. As as virtual world I mean people who enjoy the process of @CAPS5 thats why some people become. This is my statement on my opinion to what effects computers have on people.",8
521,"Dear whom ever it @MONTH1 concern, I agree with the people that this doesn't benefit society. My first reason is we don't get up and go outside. My second reason we don't sleep much. My last reason we don't do much homework. First, we don't get up and play outside, we don't enjoy the fresh air. For example, we stay playing games or listening to music, that we don't even get are exercise. People ask, ""why people gain wieght?"" @CAPS1, because they spend all the time on the computer, just sitting there. This is important because we need are exercise to get healthy, but with technology all they get is being lazy. Second, we don't get are rest, are @NUM1 hours of sleep. For example, people stay up on the computer until its atleast @NUM2 or @NUM3 o'clock in the @TIME1. What do they do through out the hours? @CAPS1, they be on myspace, yahoo, aol, and/or @CAPS2. This is important because you need to sleep to walk up to go to work, school, or even for the @ORGANIZATION1. Lastly, we don't get homework done. For example, we get name from school and get right away plugged in, is like if we are the computer's plug. Why do they rush to the computers? @CAPS1, because they want to find out about gossip or the latest games. This is important because we need are education. In conclusion, @CAPS3, we do need are computers, but not all the time not for games or myspace. This is not as important as your health or as your education. Computers don't give your life or your career, You do!",8
522,"Many people have different ideas on computers. Some say computers have positive effects and others are more towards the negative side. I am towards the negative side. With computers, companies lose money, people don'@CAPS2 get enough excircise and relationships are reducing. Computers have everything you could ever watch, play, and dream of in them. That is why companies like comcast, @ORGANIZATION1, and music industries are losing money. People don'@CAPS2 want to pay for @CAPS1., games, and music so they go on the computer to watch it. On the computer free @CAPS2.V. is very popular. You watch you favorite show whenever you want to, for free! My favorite website is @CAPS3 because it has every video you can ever want to watch. I go on there and watch it for hours. It's a really bad habit. Millions of people watch it everyday and night! Computer games are now very popular. You can play them for free and never get tired of them. I play them because I don'@CAPS2 wan'@CAPS2 to spend my money on @MONEY1 games only to have them break when I drop them; I want games that are fun and free. Doctors and experts have seen that now a days people don'@CAPS2 get enough excirsice because they are on the computer all day. This is sad because we should all play outside everyday. What's even worse is that when people are sitting infront of the computer they are eating. This does not burn calories, it infact, does the oposite. In @LOCATION1, this is our biggest problem because we are not getting the exircise or nutrition we need. People need to play outside more and become more healthy or else we'll become less active and move like boulders. Our relations with one another is very immortant for your social health and needs. It gives you a nice balance in peoples lives. Lately this has been a problem because a lot of parents are getting divorced. What do you think coused this problem. People are spending to much time at work. what are they working on I computers. When they get home they will be too focused on their work that they wan'@CAPS2 even say hi to their children and wives. This is very sad because you might never see them agian and your ignoring them. If your a child it will be the same but instead with your friends. Computers do not help your social life. Computers are a way of life for some people. They will never break the habit of it. They are sucked under the spell of the computers and it's a hard spell to break. Computers effects are not benefitial they are hurtful.",10
523,"Dear editor, I say you should let people go on the computer! A computer lets you do many activites like playing games, socializing, and many other activites. I say you should let people use computers because some people need a computer for work, kids that use computers might want to be video game designers, and you can talk to your friends or family on the computer. If your asking yourself do I really need a computer at work the answer is yes. Some jobs are different than others so you might need a different program on your computer. Take my mom for example she works of @ORGANIZATION1 and she helps people everyday on the computer and on the phone. I say all jobs should have a computer. Did you know @PERCENT1 of kids that played or is still playing video games might want to be video game designers. It's true kids enjoy playing video games on different systems. Eventhough, the computer is where all the videe games are made from. Kids that want to become video game designers want to try to beat the number I video game. Kids just love video games so much and if your addicted to your video game system you might want to become a video game desinger. Have you evern told your friend or family members you would talk to them later? Then they get mad at you because you lied and then they go on thier email and see you emailed them. That's called email you can talk to your friends or family on the computer. It's safe unless you get email from random people, you might want to stay away from those. messages are that cause viruses. Email is the way to talk to your friends or family. BLAM! Thats all I have to say about the subject. So if you didn't catch my reasons some people need a computer for thier job, people who use computers might want to be game designers, and you can talk to your friends or family on the computer.",8
524,I think people should keep their computers because they need to find job application and they need to send emails to parents to see if they got the job or not. We need computers because kids need to learn how to work with technology and work with the keys and they can play learning games on the computer that teaches them how to read write and spell. And then people who wants to exercie they can mak a plan when people get up hop on the computer and check there email then for like an hour or two they can excersize. And for college and high school kids they need computers to do a essay or exames and type a @NUM1 letter page about something and they can't do that if they don't have computers. When teachers are at work they need to go home and check our homework that was do on the computers and our grades. And job when they run through your lisense it runs through the computer to see if it's your real lisense or not. Police stations needs computers so they can run through your lisences plate. The airport need computers so they can see what flight is going where.,6
525,"Do you own a computer? Do you use it to work, play games, or even talk to family and friends? Computers are getting more and more popular, and advanced. The use of computers is liked and disliked by various people. I personally agree with the people who like using computers for these next three reasons. If you are a stay at home mom or dad, you can still work, the computer allow you to stay connected with family members and friends, and you can play fun games and such on a computer. These are my three top reasons why I think computers are useful and have a lot of benefits, I wonder what other reasons people could have! To all stay at home mom's or dad's working is not a thing of the past! You are still able to work straight from home! How appealing does that sound? To me, very! Just picture yourself waking up, not even getting out of you're @CAPS1's or if you have a laptop you don't even have to get out of bed! I would think that staying home all day but still making money would sound like a pretty great idea, don't you? Do you have relatives or old friends, or even new friends, that you want to reconnect with? The computer is a great way to do ! Websites such as facebook, myspace, or aim allow you to talk to. right now, I have a screen chatting with people, but only people I know of course! As a matter of fact, facebook helped me find my three friends from us field. When I lived in another town, they were my best friends! I recently was just talking to them. Computers are great for finding and catching up with people! Spending tons of money on pointless video games, x-boxs, or @CAPS2's? There's no need anymore! Computers have many websites with thousands of really fun games! Don't bother wasting your money on things that kids could play for free right on the computer. Even though you're still playing video games which are pretty much pointless in life, kids don't seem to think so, and you can still act great benefits like saving a lot of money! If these three reasons I stated above haven't persuaded you, I don't know what will! I think working from home, talking to friends and family, and playing fun and free games on the computer sounds great! I strongly believe computers can make you're life easier, and you can have a lot of fun on them. After reading my opinion on computers, hopefully you agree with me too!",9

My first reason is computers have postive efect on people for example they can tell you about your taxes and how much you could recive or they have collge on line were you can work on geting your dirgre if your a dropout you still can get your @CAPS1.E.D. to also on line. My second reason is it teaches hand eye coordination fore example in the school theres this program called type to learn @NUM1 and it work on you typeing skills and how you can improve on typeing skills also help you get familiar with the keys and the letters on the keyboard also there games on how you can become a beater typer. My third reason is how you can learn about far away places a good hotel you can stay for the or help find homes in or visit a frend in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 you could buck a flight or see wich one is cheaper for your bujet and you could go on @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to find were your buddy lives. I hope you consider my persuasive letter you of some reasons first it has a positive effect on people second it teaches hand eye coordination and third you can learn about far away places. I hope you consider my letter.",8
527,"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers and technology have finally caught up with humans in the twenty-first century. These new and highly created devices, known as computers, will help many people succeed and advance in the nearest future. They will help people learn, interact and get smarter through the coming ages. First, computers can help people learn anywhere and everywhere. Whether it be forgotten homework or the latest news-article, computer can help with learning. People don't like to read books; they have the internet reading over a thousand words, even if it's on @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3 or @CAPS4. Not only that, but computers can people learn about the world, by searching it on a search engine. It can help them about a places language, culture, people, food, style, and so much more, with a simple click of a mouse. Second is social interaction. Computers help people communicate to others even if they're far away. Higher and newer technologically advanced computers are very fast nowadays, downloading instant messengers will be a snap! if people have webcams with microphones (built-in or not), it can be use so much more better than a' telephone call; you get to see them and talk to them! Very convenien for families who have sons/daughers who live far away or in college, and also convenient to familes who have loved ones that are around the globe that they can't see. Lastly is computers helping people get smarter. Reading is everywhere that you see and go; so are math, science and social studies! Nowadays, textbooks are online, so they help students do their homework at home if they forgot it or if they were out sick. Online learning can also help homeschooled kids do work and college kids who are staying at home. With the help of faster, better and smarter technology, computers are a helpful and convenient device to people. Computers can help people open their minds with other places and its people and culture, talk online through @CAPS5 or online chat places with family, friends and strangers (whom you should be careful about), and learn online at home and everywhere. Thank you for time in reading my letter.",9
528,"Dear, to whom ever this @MONTH1 concern In my opinion I think that computers have an neagative affects on people. One of my reasons for feeling this way is that computers could be very harmful to people. Another reason, is that instead of exercising people are on the @CAPS1. Also lastly computers are putting people out of jobs. Computers can be very harmful. There are both of bad things on the @CAPS1, there are also lots of bad people such as child abducters, and killers. You never are really sure who you are talking to because on the @CAPS1 you can pretend to be anyone. You can never be to safe. Secondly, instead of going out and playing or exersising people much rather be on the @CAPS1. A lot of people in @LOCATION1 and all over the world are oveweight. We could all use a little exercise every and in a while. I'm sure if they were more active instead of being on youtube, myspace, facebook, or twitter the rate of people being overweight would go down. Lastly computers are putting people out of a job. A @CAPS1 could basicly do anything more than a person can do. This puts a lot of people out of work. The computers are taking their jobs away, this is not good for the economy. Lots of people need jobs at this time. This is how I feel about computers, that they are dangerous. I think they stop people from exercising. Lastly, they are putting people out of a job.",8
529,"Have you ever felt like you were missing some things in life? Do you ever wish you chose another job activity that your free time? Now, these questions can be brought to many different points but if a computer comes to mind in any of your answer you need to keep reading. I strongly believe computers have a negative effect on people. First off did you know that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 @CAPS1 are obese?! This means adults and children are spending too much time in front of the computer and @CAPS2 screens, causing a person to spend less time excersizing. Joining a gym @MONTH1 just be way for you to your social life you go from chatting on instant messaging  to having you-feel +all day you should. Everyone wants a good, strong, supportive, happy family. Happy people have trustworthy friends and know how to laugh with them. Put yourself in this position. Your best friends passed away @TIME1. you were too busy emailing and searching for friends to add on @CAPS3. You didn't answer your phone when your best friend calling because you were ""busy"" @CAPS4't let this be you so for a time to spend with your friends. Have everyone over @CAPS5 to @CAPS5. Our parents, uncles cousins, grandparents and nephews will always be there for help also love and support. A complete is far from helping anyone that so @CAPS4't let your computer become your friend. It's now or never! computers are negatively affecting people but of all this relationship with family and friends. So its your turn to go out there are support getting people. All ages to come outside become happy without computers.",8
530,"Dear @CAPS1, I feel that the effects that computers have on people is good one for two reasons. One, it allows people to get information faster. Two, it allows people to stay in contact with each other in an easier way. Here are some reasons to support my opinion. My first reason was because it allows people to get information faster. This is a good thing because it allows people to have more free time during the day to either sleep, make food for their families, exersize, or even just to lounge around. For example, a few weeks ago I had a project due for @PERSON1, I am usually very active so I didn't have enough time to do the project. When I woke up the day the project was due I freaked until I remembered that I had a computer, with the computer being there I was able to start and finish a project that would normally take me an hour with books and I finished in @NUM1 minutes and recieved a very high grade, In addition, this is why having a computer is much easier. My second reason is because it allows people to stay in contact with each other longer and in an easier way. The reason as to why I say this is because before my step mom passed away her and my step sister used to talk on email a lot. We lived in @LOCATION1 and @CAPS2 lived in @LOCATION2. Also, it is so much easier because with things such as @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and @ORGANIZATION1. Also you have to do is just sign in and type. In conclusion, these are my two reasons as to why I feel the computer has a good effect on people.",8
531,"It seems like everyone is using computer today. Male or female, young or old, everybody can benefit from a computer. They are are easy to get and have a large range of pricing. Everyone should own a computer. This technology makes communication easier, provides entertainment and can help for educational purposes. Have you ever called a friend on the phone, only to get their answering machine? If you have to tell them something important then, this can be very frustating. The internet makes talking to your friends a whole lot easier. You can type up an email to a friend you haven't talked to in a few months. You can also chat with your friends who are on the same time you are. Most internet chatting is free, so you can stay on as long as you want and not even worry about running up your bill. Several people I know use their computers to keep them entertained. When your friends are busy and there's nothing on @CAPS1 you can always go on a game website. Many stores, such as @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS2 @CAPS3 sell games you can download onto your computer as well. You can also listen to your favorite bands and discover new ones on the internet. Websites like @CAPS4 and let people watch showa from their computer that they either missed or just want to watch again. Many people are surprised when they find out computers. Whenever students have to do a research paper, the number are resource they use is @ORGANIZATION2. If people want to learn more about something on their own, The internet is a quick and simple way to do it. Instead of going to the library to take out a look, why not hop on @CAPS5 or @CAPS6 to help you with your report. Many @CAPS7 school graduates take college courses online too.Clearly, a computer is a piece of tachnology everyone can enjoy. It provides an easy way to talk to your family and friends. It puts a little fun into our lives. If you want to research anything from a vacation spot to your favorite celebrity a computer can help you. Computers really are an incredible invention.",9
532,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 people believe computers have a positive effect while @CAPS1 believe they have a negative effect. Copmuters help keep distant friends and fmaily in touch. They help save time and money for parents of bored children or lazy family members. Lastly @CAPS1 jobs and kids school careers would be different without computers. Computers have a larg, good impact on our society. Remember your best friends from college or that boy from @CAPS2 you were always to talk to! Well now with the advancements in computers you can reconnect with lost friends or distant relative. One very popular way to keep in touch is facebook, where you can serach old friends or family. In the news @CAPS3 there was an article about a @NUM1 year old girl found her father after @NUM2 years. It turned out he had been looking for her too and she visits himevery weekend. Another way to keep in touch using the computer is instant messaging or email where you can talk by typing and sending messages to each other and pictures can be sent via email to people all over the world. A last way family and friends can stay in touch is with skype which is a database you can video chat with anyone who has this sysytem downloaded on their computer. Computers not only keep people in touch they also help save time and money. Its six o'clock on @DATE1 @TIME1 and you have nothing to eat and your spouse your car. What are you going to do? Now with computers you can order to go food online or which is a service provided by stop and shop which grocery shops and delivers your food to you. Also if you need a new appliance, shoes, clothes, or what ever you @MONTH1 need you can buy it online at stores and it will be delivered for you saving you time and gas money. Lastly, you @CAPS5't have to pay for gas or arcade fees for your kids anymore because there are wide varities of games online. On good mornign @CAPS4 they interviewed a @NUM3 year old boy who had never been to an arcade and had no desire too because he could play games online. When you are done playing games you can stay at your computer and work. Amny jobs today could not be done if there weren't computers. if you stay at home or go to an office building for work you are sure to use a computer in some way to get your assignment done. Also advirtismnet companies are almost completely run off computers when you are on a site and there is a flashing box the say ""You @CAPS5!"" that is an advirtisment. Another group comuters help are students. Students can use online textbooks or get their home work assignments. For example there is a high school in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 that n o longer has textnooks fro students to bring home. The students all have laptop computers for textbooks typing assignments and other homework. Computers help get jobs done. Computers have a great impact on our society today. They help families and friends keep in touch. They save @CAPS1 people time, money and effort. Lastly, computers help students and the working class get jobs done. Computers have a good effect on people today. ",10
533,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I have been hearing about people fighting over computers and if they are or are not good for our us. But I do have to say that I think they are good. One @ORGANIZATION1 the reasons why I say this is because it will allows you to talk to friends and family that are away or they can even be accross the street. @CAPS7 over all it's a great way to keep in touch with people. It also helps kids with school work. For example you @MONTH1 find games that will help you in @CAPS2 ever class you need or you can find information on certain things that you need to know for projects. The last idea I can come up with is that you can pay your bills online. You @MONTH1 not think this is a big topic but it is. Say if you have a bill that due tomorrow you can get emails stating that you have a bill due tommorrow and how much you need to pay. @CAPS7 these are my reasons for agreeing with the fact that computers are good for us. Alright, lets get started. My first reason for thinking that computers are good for us is that you can stay in touch with people such as your friends and family. But although there is the risk @ORGANIZATION1 people talking to strangers but that is their @CAPS2 I mom by that that they mine a stupid choice and they face the consiquences. But other than that most people do the smart thing and talk to the friends @ORGANIZATION1 family @CAPS3 or @CAPS4-@CAPS5 theres just a great @ORGANIZATION1 things you can do to stay in touch with friends and family. @CAPS7 I hope you are starting to think about the good things computers do for us. Well @CAPS10 it is time to tell you my @NUM1 reason for thinking computers are for us. This topic is school working is almost every class room you walk into there is a computer. The computers really help got school work They canprovide information on projects or even provide little games for extra help and I bet @NUM2 out @NUM2 students would agree with me. For example I just had a project on the ""@CAPS6 @NUM4's"" and I used my computer to find information about @CAPS7 it I can use the @CAPS8 for school work you can to. Alright @CAPS10 to start off my third reason for thinking @CAPS8's are good for us heres a quote from @PERSON1. ""@CAPS10 that we have had @CAPS7 many advances in technology it is @CAPS7 much easier to pay your bills online."" @PERSON2 is the top guy at @ORGANIZATION1 and he even thinks that paying bills online is a great help too. Plus if you forget about a bill they will send a to your @CAPS4-@CAPS5 or even give you a call. I even think it is easy. I watch my mom pay her bills and it is just click click done. This is my final reason for thinking that computers are good for us. @CAPS10 that you have heard my ideas I hope you join me and the other @NUM5 million people that think computers. But these three topics I just wrote about are only same @ORGANIZATION1 the things that computer makes easier. There are just @CAPS7 many things you can do on the computer. @CAPS7 I hope you agree with me. But I hope you remember the computer is as easy as a click @ORGANIZATION1 a botton.",10
534,"It has come to my @CAPS1 that not everyone agress that computers benift society which I @MONTH1 add I dont think they do! In the past @PERCENT2 of people who have lived in the past days want say what they say now. My first resson is because kids who have bad health and there on computers there not doing any good for them selves either than becoming a couch potato playing computer games. But I play on computers but I still get the exercise I need to get and I like to be active. I think they should just stop selling computers cause they went get any where in life just sittin around playing world of worcraft all day. Secondly, the time it must take to download stuff thats the time you could be taken to go run a mile but I dont know. Thats your gugs porogaitive. Dr. @PERSON1 from the brain clinic on computers has stayted more than @PERCENT1 of people who have computers tend to stop doing there social activities and foucus more on video games and not there school work. If I was a parent I would through the computer out the window. In conclusion I dont I think its a good benifit in society to have computers. I urge you to change what you half to do in order to change this society to be better and healthyer thoun it is right now. Well desion is up to you.",8
535,"I think that computers doesn't benefits society. I agree with that because people send too much time on the computers, talk to people they don't know and watch things they souldn't be watching. One reson I think that computers don't benefit us is people send too much time on it. I use to be on the computers all the time, but when @DATE1 came and my family went on a trip, I saw what I became without a computer around. I also saw that I was pulling myself away from my family, so I said that I will not go on the computer for a long time. So now, I hang with my family more, then if I want to, I go on the computer for @NUM1 min. (but most of the time I don't) But as you can see, I almost lost myself to the computer and that is way I don't think computers benefits us. Reson two I think that computer don't help us is you could be talking to someone you think you know, but don't. You can be a teen on the computer talking to your ""friend"" when your ""friend"" is @NUM2 years old. You put and show stuff that will get some old guy to want you, and he or she will pull the information out of you if you let them it out. They can ask you stuff that will help them find you and you wouldn't know. That is another reson I belevae that computers do not benefits you. The last reson I belevae computers are not benefits is kid and teens will watch stuff they souldn't be on it. I have a friend, fath, and she was so good, but then she move away and I didn't see her for two yaers. When she move back she change and she said because she saw stuff on the computer, everthing changed for the way she see things. I didn't want to be friends with her anymore because of what she saw, on the computer. Also, my cuosin's friend does the same thing and got my doing it so I don't talk to her any more. See what the computer does to people. That is why I think the computer does not help us, because it get you to slit you and your family, talk to people you don't know, and watch things that you souldn't watch.",7
536,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, although use on @CAPS1, I still believe the computer has a positive effect on society. The computer helps our society with a lot of things, like learning, to talk to far away reletives, and it also helps school with the different programs for teaching. I know some people say people are spending too much time on the computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends. Lets talk about learning. The computers helps kids learn hand-eye coordination which could help in sports and other activities. It also lets you learn about far away places today not a few years ago like in books. It teaches responsibility also by letting kids chose betwee the good and the bad websites. Having a computer also allows you to talk to people wich is a good thing because some people have faraway reletives that they dont talk to on the phone often. It lets you talk to close friends if you dont have a phone. It also lets you to communicate with long distant friends. The computer helps with teaching too. For example, teachers use @ORGANIZATION2 word to create their notes. The computer is hoolsed up to smart board wich is constantly used. Teachers base a lot of activities for the use of the computer. The teachers assign students projects that must be done by a computer. The computer as you see has a lot of positive affects on society, which is a good thing.",8
537,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In these few years, technolgy is more edvanced than ever. That means more and more people are using computers all the time. Some people thought that using computer is not a good idea. But I believe in an other theory, and there is lots of great things computer brought us in our live. Use of computer teaches hand-eye coordination, give the ability to learn more, and allow people to talk with others. The hand-eye coordination really helps people in daily lives. First, all jobs today are all revolding around computers. @CAPS6, having a sence of using a computer is needed in order for people to get a job. In fact, high school are having classes to teach student about and how to use the computer. In class, the teachers teachs hand-eye coordination that allows the students to type faster. As one of my teacher back in @NUM1 grade said, ""@CAPS1 I was in high school, people pays me to type for them!"" @CAPS2 that we can see that person is having lack of hand-eye coordination which forced him to pay some one else to type his papers. If that person has proper hand-eye coordination in order to type fast, he might have a better job that what he had now. Computer also allows people to learn more. Secondly, computer give people the ability to learn about far away places and people. Last marking periode, I did a project on the top @NUM2 @CAPS3 countries to go for vacation in. Without computer, I wouldn't be able to know the facts about these countries and finish my project. Computers has websites you can search anything you want. For example, @PERCENT1 of people in a company is searching stuff about other people. That other people might be their customers or, and these informations they got will help them get the bussiness case easier. In addition, people came up with websites that allows you to talk with others @CAPS2 far away. @CAPS4, a website where everyone in the world can join to talk and chat with friends or others. I guss you have an account on @CAPS4 just like me or your friends. As a research shows @PERCENT2 of junior high and senior high students goes home and the first thing that do after turning on the computers is loging on to @CAPS4 to see if their friends are on. I, personal, moved for an other country to @LOCATION1 @CAPS6, there are families of mine in my home country. The internet on the computer allowed me to talk to them on a webcam. Without computer my life will have a hole in it, because I won't know how my family is doing. I think that everyone who came @CAPS2 or other country think the same way as I do. In conclusion, using a computer is not a bad idea. It proves people hand-eye coordination, to learn more about faraway places, and talk to others faraway easily. If there was no computer, there won't be a @NUM3 centery as we called it. So, the using of computer is a wonderful thing.",10
538,"I think that computers are good because you can communicate with family and friends trough a webcam or other local websites such as myspace, twitter, and facebook and also to play games and watch funny videos. But also we learn from the incyclopidia and google and other websites to get an education computers are helpful to us and we need computers because without them how are our young ones going to learn how to use computers. Also with out computers we cant know how are family and friends are doing and because we have computers dosn't mean that we can not use them. My father always told me he never went to school or college and he never got an education or how to use computers. thats why he wants me to use computers because he wants me to teach him how to use computers. Computers are helpful and we cant get an education without them yea we have teachers and they can give us an education but not as much as computers because technology is important to us. Also how are homeless people going to learn to use computers. Also how are people that didn't go to school are going to learn how to use computers.",7
539,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you know that the computer companies think that people spend too much time on them? They also say we use computers so much, that we don's get any exersize? Basicly, the companies dont think that people should use computers. I disagree with this very much. I disagree eith this because people can exersize when ever they want to, people need computers for work/school, and if you don't have any kind of phone, you need to @CAPS3-mail them or talk to them on @ORGANIZATION1. My first reason why I dissagree with the computer companies is that people can go out and exersize when ever they want. Most people don't sit in front of the computer all day. They will get up and exersize around the block, or on a work out machine. If people do not exercize and do not get off the computer then they are wrong. People can make their own decision. My second reaon why I disagree with the computer companies is because people need computers for work and school. Kids and adults get a lot of projects these days. When they do get assigned one they most likely will need to type it up. Also, people with projects might need to get information on a famous person, and yes i know that that is what books are for , and if they dont have that person, then they need the computer. The computer is handy for prodjects and essays. My final reason why I disagree with the computer companies is if you don't have a phone and need to talk to them, you need the computer to @CAPS3-mail or talk to them on @ORGANIZATION1. If we didnt have the computers, and someone didnt have a phone, then they would not be able to tell them what they need to tell them. What if it was important? Or an emergency? The would never know... In conclution, The computer companies think that we dont need computers, and don't get enough exersize. I think they want, people need them for work/school projects, and because if you dont have a phone, then you need to @CAPS3-mail or talk to them on @ORGANIZATION1. You need to wake up and realize we need computers. You need to keep computers in this world! ",9
540,"Dear Experts, I completaly agree with your idea that people should get out more and enjoy nature istead of being glued to a computer screen. I will be listing three reasons why people should not be attached to a computer. I hope you will understand my reasons. Computer screen damage your eyes by @PERCENT1! @CAPS2 example my eyes start to hurt whenever I stare at any kind of screen. And I work at the @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1 so I can get away from the harmful screen. When you finally understant and knew your computer like your best friend, @CAPS1!!! It becomes your new best friend. You will never want to go to the outside world and become a lonely in never seeing anybody and the . I have gone to the trouble of interviewing his life. He said, ""first I woke up to find my on the keyboard and leaning of to my left and to my right at ,"" @CAPS2 breakfast he finishes his ""computer."" You don't see computer all day?!? Why are you! And example with my work at the @ORGANIZATION2 (@ORGANIZATION1) is that I get to get out of the house and have fun. Third people who stay at home with no friends and are studying, @CAPS2 example @CAPS3, never find out about nature. I exremely love my job because I got to be with nature Nature I feed the animals and get to go outside and admire the beauty of the world. @CAPS2 the computer! new you know my reasons and I with had I write. I agree with your statements like many others and I hope I can help you put it into action.",7
541,"There has been an arguement that people spend more time on the computer instead of being outside. I disagree because most people don't own computers, also, two out of three people prefer spending time with friends, and if people do own a computer they are mostly for business purposes. Yes, computers do give people the ability to learn about far away places and they do teach hand-eye coordination, but that's not all they've good for. Some parents don't allow their children to own laptops or computers because of online chatting, inappropriate games, or inappropriate photos/videos. On that note, children are able to play outside get exercise, hang with friends, go to special events, etc. The parents are preventing their children from harm, inappropriate behavior/language, and from being lazy. The parents are realrcing the dangers of the internet. Would you rather sit a home staring at a bright screen or go to the mall, park, or basketball game with your friends? In fact, two out of three people would rather be with their friends. Some reasons you should be with your friends is you won't miss out on the latest gossip or the jokes that would only be funny if you were there. I could go on and on with a list of reasons why you should be with your friends and family instead of wasting your life on the computer for hours. Your friends need you now, your computer is always going to be there, but not your friends. The computer is also used for business purposes as well. There are jobs where people have to write long papers. So, the computer helps people become successful. I highly doubt people who own computers waste their vauluable time playing internet games rather than exercising with sports. Besides, who wouldn't want to take a break from the computer after writing along paper and staring at a screen for hours. I think I have made my opinion clear that people don't waste their time on computers. I think people understand that friends and family are more important than a computer. Also, if experts believe we are wasting out time on computers, then stop giving school technology privalages to have laptops and palm pilots.",9
542,"Dear @CAPS1, I feel that computers have a negative effect on the population. You can do different things becide using the computer to acheve ""hand eye"" corrdination, talk to people in different ways, and gain information other than looking it up online. First of all, there are other ways to get ""hand eye"" corrdination besides playing on the computer. Playing sports such as fencing or baseketball can help you. Fencing is not just stabbing each other with sticks, it takes a great deal of mental focus and hand corrdination. Bascketball makes you work with your hands and feet all at the same time. It also teaches you teamwork which can come in very handy in the buisiness world. Next, while doing these activities you get fit. A computer does not strengthen you musles, besides finger musles, but excersise does. Playing sports is a great way to do it, expessally if you enjoy doing it. Even taking a musical instrument will help you gain ""hand eye"" corrdination. Playing the piano, for example will help your corrdination. After you active great ""hand eye"" corrdination, try doing other activities that help you set your next goal. In conclusion, while playing on a computer will allow you to get ""hand eye"" corrdination, doing a sport or playing an instrument wil help you more. To continue, some people think that the only way to talk to your friend is on a computer but it is not. To begin, there is a machine called a phone you could use. It is a better way to go because you can do something else while talking like gardening or looking. Also, letters can be usful, too. You might not be able to have a conversation but you can enjoy knowing how someone is doing like if they are on vacation. Finnally, it is the one thing I think most people today have forgoten is talking to someone in the same room. People have been doing this since the of man. Not talking over the phone or texting or email. Just looking at each other and talking at them, not in a phone or over a text message. To summerize, there are a lot of ways to talk to another person without using a computer. Finally, if we want to know something, we do not have to go emeditly go to the computer. The library is a great place to go and you might find a book there that you might to want to read. Libraries are one of the least visited spots in the @LOCATION1. Since you can look up anything online people have completly forgotten it. There is also a school. Teachers love to help people learn about things because that is there job. Finally, there are your parents. They know it all because they learned about it, too and love to bring it back to their mind. To conclude, more and more people each day turn to the internet to know things but there are places and people that know it, too. To wrap it up, computers effect on people is a negative relationship. People believe the only way to get ""hand eye"" corrdination is through the computer but there are other ways to do it, also if you want talk to someone you need to do it online and finally, information can not only be found online but, in places like the library. This is why I feel the the hold computers have on people is a negative one.",9
543,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1 waster your free time, on a beautiful, sunny day, in front of computer screen? In reality, computers don't have a positive effect on people. Instead of spending time outside or exersizing, @CAPS2 stay indoors at the computer. Also @CAPS2 lose sight of important things like spending time with friends and family, and @CAPS2 have pretty much lost face to face communication. @CAPS2 need to start going back to the times where @CAPS2 didn't worry about the computers and get back to worrying about the important things. Instead of spending time outside and exersizing, poeple just sit at heir computer. People blame @ORGANIZATION1 and other fast food placs for obesity, but computers can take the blame too. @CAPS2 forget to go the park and jog, but yet @CAPS2 remember to check our email for the fifth time. I'm sure there are people who do get to the gym and still spend time at the computer, but then there are the majority who don't. Computers take away the aspect of playing outside or exersizing at the gym and @CAPS2 need to start getting back to that. Secondly, @CAPS2 lose sight of the important things like spending time with friends and family. ""@CAPS2 forget about going to @LOCATION1's for dinner or having our friends sleepover,"" says one scientist. @CAPS2 are so worried about missing out on a chance to @CAPS3 someone that @CAPS2 don't go play catch with our brothers and sisters. @CAPS2 forget to make dinner once in a while to give our parents a break @CAPS2 need to start worrying about who and what is really important in our lives, and not the next new way to talk to our friends. Lastly, @CAPS2 have really lost face to face communication @CAPS2 don't worry about meeting with our friends to catch up, @CAPS2 just talk with them in a chatroom. Think about the best friend you haven't seen in @NUM1 years wouldn't you rather see them again, than type the words you want to say? Teenagers how-a-days just open up their cell-phone and send a text message to say""hi"" or they just open up facebook on their computer and chat with someone. @CAPS2 need to step away from the computer and step back into reality. I see how someone might say ""But it's just easier. You have a barrier in front of you and you don't have to worry about messing up."" But really they are jsut saying that whatever they are saying is not something to be said in person, so they shouldn't be saying it all. I think that @CAPS2 should all step back and think about how computers have taken over our lives. Instead of going to the gym @CAPS2 sit at the computer, @CAPS2 forget about what is really important, and, also, @CAPS2 have lost face to face communication. @CAPS2 need to get a hold of ourselves and start thinking about how computers really effect our lives. I really think @CAPS2 should step away from the computer and in step into a pair of running shoes and go for a jog.",10
544,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I do not think computers are having a good effect on our society. They are not improving the health of the users, in fact, it is quite unhealthy, the users can't enjoy real life, and they spend less time interacting with real people. I know by the end of this letter you will agree with me. Over using computers is very unhealthy. @CAPS4 using a computer, time escapes from people, and the spend MUCH less time exercising. Doctor @ORGANIZATION1 says ""@CAPS4 watching @CAPS5 or using a computer people just keep eating if there is a bag of food in front of them, even if they are already full, it is one of the leading reasons for obesety"", @CAPS6 you can see, using a computer is a lot less healthy than it seems. Another problem with using a computer is that people don't enjoy real life. The user gets caught up in a vertual world that isn't even real. The real senery of outside isn't seen, wich can make people unhappy, and they don't know why. Also, @NUM1 people can get extremely caught up in virtual games, and forget about real life alltogether. Scientist @PERSON1 says ""@CAPS7 computer games can lead to depressionbecause the user doesn't get involved in real life, wich can lead to depression without then knowing it."" Computers aren't looking so good now, are they? Last, but ceartanly not least, using the computer causes the user to spend less time interacting with real people. People who think computers are improving our society say that you can talk to people online, but truthfully, it is not the same. People don't build social skills from talking online, wich can seriously damage children's entire life. Also, little kids are actting too atached to the computer, they come hom, and get on the computer. This causes childrens social lifes to be deprived. Computers are taking kids lives away. @CAPS6 you can see, computers are not @CAPS6 harmless @CAPS6 they seem at first glance. They are very unhealthy, restrict the user from enjoying real life, and the user spends less time interacting with real people. We need to find a way to stop this before it becomes a bigger problem than it already is!",9
545,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, With the wave of technology that comes with the twenty first century, computers have been a huge success. Almost everyone uses them reguarly, but are they really helping or hurting the ones that use them? Computers are not a nessesary part of life, and it would be benifical to all if we cut down on their use. Did you know that more than half the people in @LOCATION1 are overweight? With the oncoming swell of technology something else has been coming ur right behind it, @CAPS1. More and more people are becoming overweight because of their lack of exercise, and healthy eating. According to the editor in @CAPS2 magazine @PERCENT1 of people who use computers for more than half an hour a day are more overweight than the people who use them less. But the sad thing is, that most peole don't even realize they're being sucked in by their computer. As their local newspaper, it is up to you to tell the people about the dangers of overuse of their computers. Computers are also living people away from the outside world. When go to the mall with your friend if you can just order the same stuff online? Why go to the movies with your family when you can watch the same thing on you tube few free? People are thinking like this and they probably don't even realize it! Friends and family members can also talk to you on the computer with just a press of a button. This over extensive use of this electronic can not be healthy for people. Humans are ment to intract with each other, not sit in a house all day! It has also been proven that harrasment levels have gone up since the invention of the computer. This electronic makes it easy for people to bully other people online. This is espesially present among young adults, with the ever popular myspace and facebook.! A few taps on the keys and a mouse click, thats how easy it could be to bully someone online. Even if you wanted justice cyber bullres can make their identities unknown online. Bullying can make someone lose their confedince and self-esteem, which is never good for kids at such a young age. While computers can sometimes make our everyday lives easier, it is evident that they do more harm than good. They are the causes of weight gain in some people, the cause of bullying in another, and can even pull people away from their family's. It would benefit everyone if we cut down on there use",8
546,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I for one believe that computers do benefit people. They help people live their daily lives, they help society learn, and they help people interact together. If I didn't have a computer I couldn't chat with my friends or check the weather. The computer can be addicting but you choose how much you use it. This why I believe computers are a benefit to the @CAPS6. People rely on computers everyday for their daily lives. People use the computer for checking their email and for writing letters and papers. The computer helps us with @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS4 @CAPS7 we can writing things and make backup coies incase it gets lost. Were suposed to go forward in life and invent @CAPS1 things. Were not suposed to go backwards to writing draft after on parchment with a bottle of ink and. That is why I believe we should use computer to benefit our daily life. My second reason that computers are a benefit is because they help us learn. Whenever there is a @CAPS4 that I don't know I go to @CAPS5 to look it up. I know I can use a dictionary but the computer saves me time and energy. The computer also has @CAPS6 news that you learn about and it has more than just two peoples points, it has all the points from the people who rare what they think they should do. In general if you want to find a product you google it, or I do, @CAPS7 you get a ton of results and they can lead you to other things too. That is why I believe computers benefit you in learning. Computers have a third benefit, which is they help you interact with your friends and peers. If your friend is sick and has the flu you can chat him online or do a wedchat to tell him something. It benefits both of you because you friend gets to talk to you and you don't get sick. If you have a friend in another state or another country then you can chat with them. If you send letters it'll be to slow. Whenn you chat with others like on @CAPS8 you can meet @CAPS1 people who like the same things as you. This why computers are beneficial to people. As I've said before computers are beneficial because they help people with their daily lives, they help society learn as a whole, and they help people interact together. These are the reasons ehy I believe computers are beneficial to people. You said that people need to get exercise instead of spending time on a computer. What are you going to say next you want a on cars.",10
547,"Have you ever imagined people around the world spending too much time in the computer and not being able to enjoy life? In my opinion people should spend less time in computers. Computers is a great distraction for people, especially kids. People should spend less time in computers and more time doing other things like for example spending more time with their family, exercising, and doing their work. @CAPS1 people do all of this things they will become more responsible and enjoy life. My first reason why people should spend less time in computers and more time with their family is because they will be better persons. A phycologist once sayd ""@CAPS1 a children spends time with their family then there is an enormous chance that that person will become someone in the future."" Spending time with your family is really important because you feel that you're loved and that your family cares for you. Doctors have found that when people grow up with a strong connection between them and their family, it make life easier for that person. Therefore @CAPS1 you spend more time with your family you will accomplish all of these things. My second reason why people should spend less time in computers and more time exercising is because you will decrease your chances of death. Researchers have found that @CAPS1 you exercise @NUM1 hour a day everyday day you will decrease your chances of death. Eexacising will not just decrease the chances of death, it will also make you look better physically. In addition you will also be healthier. I implore you to start exercising so that way you will have a long period of life. @CAPS1 you start exercising you will be able to of this things. My third reason why people should spend less time in computers and more time doing their work is because it will help them improve their grades. I have seen people spending more time in computers and less time doing work. The board of education have researched that @CAPS1 a student spends more time doing their work and less time in computers then their grades will increase by a lot. spending more time on your work will increase a students having capability. Teachers say that @PERCENT1 of the students who do their work have A and @CAPS2 in their classes. The other @PERCENT1 of the students have @CAPS3 and @CAPS2. @CAPS1 you start doing your work then your grades will definetly increase. @CAPS1 you want to accomplish all of these things then you have to spend less time in computers. Computers is the number @NUM1 distraction for all the people around the world. I implore you to spend less time in computers and more time with your family, exercising, and doing your work. @CAPS1 you try all these things I assure you that you will be able to accomplish them yet you will became a responsible and a better person.",11
548,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 was you life like before there were the of advances in technology that we have today? Can you sincerely say that your personal and career life has become more efficient? Well, this is indeed because of computers. I believe that computers are the reason why our society has grown today, therefore I strongly feel opinionated that computers have positive effect on people. One reason that I think computers have a positive effect is because it allows you to be educated on news and certain topics rapidly. The next reason is because they allows you to communicate with others instantly. Lastly, computers have a positive effect on the environment. Imagine yourself living before the @DATE1. Think about @CAPS13 you would feel if you heard about a product that brought you into a separate world; a world where you could find anything out all in the comforts of your home. That world, writers at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, is the world wide web. The internet allows you to seek information from your own home, without making visit to the library! Also, if you forget to pick up daily newspaper or your magazine, don't worry because you can likely find coverage of that article online. Nowadays with parents walking around to try to get through the recession, children don't have the ability to get a ride to the back a library @CAPS8, no worries because your can read articles and discover it online. And even shop! @CAPS9 proven by these computers are a positive effect on humans for the reasons allowing this to live their but in a more orderly and the next reason why I strongly support the opinion that computers have a positive effect on people is because it allows all people to communicate with other @CAPS9 of today there are social networking @CAPS10 @CAPS11, iChat, and @CAPS12 a @PERCENT1 of people said that they these application of that @PERCENT1, @PERCENT2 said their lives has change for they can even take to in other of the and their bills have goo down! You know the communication They when it comes to computer @CAPS13 many times a day do you yourself observe or overhear people talking about being agreed! Surprisingly, an easy way to obtain a main goal in life to be green is owning a computers with email accounts accesable to the majority of @CAPS14, there is no need to use paper any larger. When you'd like to spread news it is common now for people to use email instead of making flyers out of paper. Also, I have heard about many newspapers going online so they don't waste paper by printing the news. Another example are students simply emailing their teachers their papers, instead of printing them. All in al I hope you see my points save the trees and go buy a computer, because computers not only make a positive effect on people, but also the environment. Computers, experts say, are the advance of the generation. Is this good or is it bad? You @MONTH1 asks. I clearly stated that I believe computers do in fact have a positive effect on people. One reason is because they educate you and allow you to recieve information on news much quicker. Next, they supply on accessable way to communicate. Lastly, they make for an better environment. I trust that you will make the right decision, fellow computer users, while forming your opinion.",10
549,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Have you ever thought of how hard it would be to publish newspapers without computers? I have, and having to write hundreds of papers daily can be a pain. Computers have made our lives safer and more interesting. Our country's @CAPS16 is based on computers. I understand that people are becoming lazy and unhealthy because of this, but advances in technology positioned the @LOCATION1 as one of the most powerful countries in the world. The richest man in the world is @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5, or @CAPS3 @CAPS4. He is famous for @ORGANIZATION2, a company that makes computers and computer platforms, like @CAPS8 @NUM1 and @CAPS8 @CAPS10. But why is he rich? Because people need computers. People need to communicate with each other. I myself know a lot more about computers than most people I know. This is because my father is a computer engineer. I know that computers can do things we can only imagine. We can find cures for diseases, like @CAPS11, @CAPS12 and diabetes. Yes, Computers might take away time that should be spent outside, playing a sport or watching nature. Some people might just turn on the @CAPS13.V to the @ORGANIZATION1, or play sports on their @CAPS14 @NUM2. That's too far, substituting exercise of your body for exercising your thumbs. But many jobs, @CAPS15 systems, and @CAPS16 systems depend on computers to work. Computers are very important to this world. I agree we are too dependant on computers, but if you are using computers for a good reason, there is no reason you shouldn'@CAPS13 use it. Everyone uses something related to computers atleast once a day.",8
550,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 opinion is that computers should only be used for a little while, use when nessacary, or to exersice a lot if you want to stay on the computer a lot. First of all I say stay on the computer for a little while because if you stay on too long your eyes will get bloodshot, no time with family, and only stay on a bit if your playing a game. Only use when nessacary such as doing homework or looking up information, or just want to import save photos. Games are fine but not too much. And if you're a person that hes to stay on the computer for work or something, you must exercise, to stay on a lot. I say this because if you @CAPS4't exercise and you stay on a lot, it wont benefit you in any way, you will have bad health, and it will be hard to work in an office, if you @CAPS4't exercise. This is why I say ""@CAPS4't stay on the computer a lot. Only for a little while, use when nessacary, and, you must exercise if you do stay on a lot. You should agree with me too.",6
551,"Dear, local Newspaper I belive that we should advance in technology because I think computers have a positive effect on people. It allows people to talk online with other people, they teach hand-eye coordination, and it gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. @PERCENT1 of the world thinks that talking online is better than talking on the phone. And you can set up a web cam so when it's not nice out side you can hook up your web cam and talk see each other with out leaving the house. If you dont have a phone you can go on you computer and email each other save you money to. My @CAPS1 will said when he had a computer it tought him good hand eye coordination but now that he dose not have a computer he lost that coordination. @PERCENT2 of the population of amaricans said with out hand I coordination. It gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. like me I found my true love on the internet. More people find there lover's on the online chat room. Would you rather find you wife online then in person I wouldn't. It is a better experense. And you @MONTH1 be able to look a job on @ORGANIZATION1. I have a possitive effect on this letter.",7
552,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In the question if technology is bad or good, I believe it is causing more harm then good. This is because I think people are spending more time with computer then necessary. Here are some examples. The more time people are on computer the less socially interactive they become. For example, if a computer dominates your job, you can be missing time with co-workers. Also if childs life is dominated by computers it can be bad for their future. If a child doesn't make friends it's ok, but if doesn't learn how he could be in trouble. For instance, if a child spent most of their time on computers and don't learn to make friends when they are older they will have no one to rely on so they could become depress in their lonely world. Also they could become obese. This could happen if a child spent time on a computer not exercising they will just gain pounds which is bad for there future. If this cycle develops and then progressed our comunity could be very bad because we could turn into fat socially people. An addiction to computers could easily be developed because when you spend a lot of time on it you could become addicted to it. This would be bad because you would spend all your time on it apart from everything. Within this addiction you could develope many bad things. For starte is you probably would damage your eyes, and or everything I've talked about before, (obesity, depression, no friends) The final way that the computer is bad is because it prevents you from living a good life. For example if you developed any circumtance that I stated before you probably would be unhappy. Happines is one of the few qualities that makes life bearable. In my life I also think that sports and family are important so once again if you developed any of my previous examples it would be hard to communicate with a family or participate in sports!. As you can see computers are not helpful for any society.",8
553,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers have a negative effect on people such as being unhealthy, not enjoying the world, and spending time with family. My first reason why going on the @CAPS7 is a negative effect be because it is unhealthy. Would you rather stay in the house all day and never get an excercise? If you are on the @CAPS7 all day, you most likely are going to gain weight because you have to eat. Now you know why the @CAPS7 can make you unhealty. My next reason why the @CAPS7 is a negative effect is you won't be able to enjoy the world. You be so cought up with the @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and @CAPS5 that you won't have any time for yourself. I remember watching a show and the lady was on the @CAPS7 so much that she was scared to go outside. So. i think it is very important to enjoy world other than the @CAPS7. My last reason why computers have such a negative effect on people is because, people won't spend enough time with family. Many people won't spend time with there family because they are so obsessed with there new computers. My mom always says / ""@CAPS6 if it is the last time you seen me"". @CAPS6 if it was the last time you see your family? Would you rather stay home with your @CAPS7? or spend time with your family? now you know my final reason why computers are a negative effect. As you can see, Computers are a negative effect because, they are unhealthy, you won't have time to explore thw world, and you won't spend a lot of time with your family.",7
554,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 is bliss. Computers give this to us and more. They give us useful skills, we get so much of our @CAPS1 from computers, and it helps us in our everyday life. Computers are very much a positive in our lives. We get so many useful skills from computers such as, hand-eye coordination. They're so many programs to help people read, write better, learn different languages and the list goes on. In fact, many people take online student classes for high school or college. This is very helpful for people who have kids, jobs or money problems. Computers gives us important @CAPS1. We have so much technology helping dotors and researchers find cures to harmful illnesses. Moreover, without computers it would make it hard to help cure people with illnesses. Schools everywhere in the world use computers because kids learn so much more at a faster rate, About @PERCENT1 of students who use computers for learning go to college. Almost every college out there gives their students: lab tops. Why would we want to take away @CAPS1 from our young people? Computers help people in their everyday life. Many people check the news, weather, and more. People can'@CAPS2 always get to a @CAPS2.V. so computer are there. People need to know whats going on around them.

555,"Dear Local Newspaper, More and more of my friends are beginning to use computers, and while many of them think it is beneficial and needed. I think it does not help society and can be a disdvantage to people in the modern day. For example, the computers people use are very time consuming and while they are the computers they are missing out on the opprtunity to play and get fresh air. Also, even though computers chane communication websites, you can't communicate face to face which is a needed skill when people are looking for jobs and when people are on computers they are missing out on enjoying nature. First off, everyone in the world needs exercise and it is what keeps them in shape that if people don't get at least on hour of excercise a day they can become overweight and get sick. If people are on computers @CAPS1 the time and everyday they will have no time for excercise and they will be in more danger of being sick or overwieght. Even though the computers is an advance piece of technology, you cant get your daily excercise from it, you need to actually, take the time and go outside to get thee excercise you need. Also a way people can get excercise is by playing sports. Sports because it doesn't only a way to get to know people, make new friends, and find your hidden talents. It is that @PERCENT1 people who play sports find what they want to do when they ate they finsl and know then what @CAPS1 in @CAPS1, I think that because people use not getting enough exercise. It is proven that the number one thing that people need as a skill when going for a job is communication skills and that will be hard to achieve if everyone is changing to communicate online because it is not the. For example, many jobs in the modern day need interactions between people and its is hard to interact with people. If you dont di it regularly. @CAPS1 in @CAPS1 , I think computers are hurting society because people are not communicating face to face. Lastly, I think computers are non- benifical because while people are wasting time on the computer they are not enjoying the nature and the things around them. They are @CAPS1 too focused on the computers screen, not on the beauty of natures brings everyone. It is proven that @PERCENT2 pf people who enjoy nature are more happy and are not as depressed as others. @CAPS1 in @CAPS1, I think that computers are wasting society because people are not getting fresh air and enjoying nature. In conclusion, the computers in our modern day can be very benefical because of the things it can do, but it is not as important as other things in our world.",10
556,"I walked into the computer lab at school, and I saw all my classmates doing research for a project on the internet. I thought about how. I wouldn't even know how to do research for a project without the extremely convenient and easy internet. I think the efffects that computers have on us are not very good. Because of computers, we have cyber bullying I read an article about a girl named @PERSON1 who get cyber bullyed. @PERSON1 was on @CAPS1, a social networking site, and she get chated by these ""popular"" girls at school. The girls started making fun of her and saying lots of mean things to her. This continued happening for and finally. @PERSON1 got so fed up and started to believe the terrible things the girls said. @PERSON1 comitted suicide because of what these girls said. Those girls would never said than false things to @PERSON1's face. But they had the courage when they were able to hide behind their computer screens. @CAPS2 it for those effects that have, people would not be getting increased and bullyed over the internet. When people spent so much to not. There is this boy, in my class whos all of his going into the computer all of the he plays daily. He and therefore, he is overweight. @CAPS2 he didn't the computer as a I think get outside and some real games instead of th that he gets no out of. Computers in our society are a big of obesity in @LOCATION1. Children do not know how to do research without the internet. The first thing I think of when my teachers give me projects that require research is 'what website should I go on?' or 'I hope good sources come up on @ORGANIZATION1.' @CAPS2 I had to do all of my research by going to the library and looking thrugh books. I wouldn't know where to start. When we are given a resource such as the computer, people take advantage of it and don't know how to live without it. I think kids should learn how to use other resources (like books) instead of always relying on the internet. When I think of all the things the computer can do, I'm amazed! But computers have not helped us. In fact, they have done the exact opposite; they have hurt us. There is no way of recovering from all of this damage computers have done; but we can take it one step at a time, decreasing some of the technology that, is poluting lives, health, and edjucation. Computers do not have a positive effect on people, but we, as a country can change that.",9
557,"Dear readers, I’m sure almost everyone out there has a computer. I understand that some people are concerned about the amount of time the average american spends on the web, but the computer is the key to a learning experience. The computer teaches us things such as hand-eye coordination and now even how to read! They give information on other people, places and cultures. The computer even lets us communicate with others. The computer is a learning tool. When people use it they’re learning hand-eye coordination. That skill later helps them do things like sports. With the advances in technology, the computer is becoming more helpful. In some cases it is how people learn to read. So don’t you see, the computer is a great thing for people to use? Information is always needed. The web can show you about people, places and cultures. In school we use computers for reports and projects. It is the fastest and easiest way to find information. If computers weren’t used as much as they are, students could be failing school. Adults also use the computer. Some jobs even require adults to be on a computer all day. The computer is a necessity. Communication is most important I know that people are worried because of online predators, but if you are informed on how to protect yourself them, then it’s ok. If we used computers then how could we talk to relatives and friends in other places who don’t have? Intelligent parents are letting their kids use computers for hours. It lets them learn to comunicate with others. I agree that at some point everyone should go and exercise and enjoy nature, but that doesn't have to give up the computer. It teaches us hand-eye coordination and how to read. Also it gives us information about almost everything. And finally because it lets us comunicate with others.",8

Computers benefit people by letting them talk to family and friend. The benefit is that if you haven’t seen a family member in a long time, the computer lets you talk to them as much as you want.

Another thing is that if you are into other things the internet helps you learn about it. Computers benefit people in many ways.

Adults and children have started to @CAPS3 addicted by the computers. Computers have been affecting exercise time, family time, and knowledge. These are all negative consquences to both adults and children. A recent study has shown that more computers are being sold each year to both adults and children. Its great to @CAPS3 outside and enjoy the fresh air. Running around the fields playing tag, hide and seek, and frisbee are all fun activities you do outside. However, computers are starting to take this away from kids and adults. Everyday the obesity level is starting to rise. More and more kids are staying inside to go facebook, myspace, twitter, and to play games. These kids and adults come home from school or work and stay on the computer the rest of the @TIME1. Since their not exercising they are gaining wait. This is causing kids and adults to start going over weight and starting to reach obesity, when you exercise you feel good about yourself and when your obes you don't want to go out in public because of the way you look. Its fun to exercise with your friends. Join a team at school or @CAPS3 outside at least an hour a day. This will help you - stay in shape. If your having trouble losing wait watch your diet. Stay away from fatting foods like cheeseburgers, fries, and milkshakes. Make sure you eat fruits and vegetables. Spending time with your family is great. Watching the big game, playing outside, and talking are great ways to interact with your family. Now most kids dont even go downstairs to say ""hi"" because their to busy on the computer. While on the computer they miss out on having a couple laughs with the family. One day something might go wrong with a family. If you were on the computer you would feel guilty because you didn't even say hello to them. Its better to go downstairs and talk for a little, rather than hiding in your room playing on the computer. A recent study has been done at @ORGANIZATION1 saying that some kids don't even know who their @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 are. Spending hours and hours a day on the computer isn't doing anything good about your education. In fact, its making you even dumber. Spending countless hours on the computer isn't going to @CAPS3 you far in life. Its fine to so on the computer for a little but @CAPS3 off and read a book. While on the computer your not learning anything from myspace, facebook, or twitter. These sites dont help you in anyway. Your brain will start to only focus on the computer and nothing else. President @PERSON1 has made many speeches about how computers affect your knowledge. ""@CAPS3 out and play an hour a day."" Exercising is great and can be fun. Cooking with mom and playing with dad will create special bonds. Losing knowledge isn't good. Exercising, spending time with the family, and knowledge are all negative consquences when computers come into play. If you have a computer at home make sure you stay away. Go outside, read a book, or go for a hike. These will all benefit you more than being a computer bum.",10
561,"Dear newpaper, I am writing to you to tell you why computers are good to have. Computers are good to have because they have the ability to teach people about faraway places and people. It also teachs people hand-eye coordination, and it even allows people to talk on line with other people. Now getting into my letter, computers are good because they have the ability to teach people about faraways places and people. For a social studies project a couple of years ago that I did was about the southern part of @LOCATION1 and we did it on @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION4, and we looked a lot of it on line and we learned lots of new things we didn't now before we did the project and if we didn't have computers it would be really hard to find all of that information. Now my second reason why computers are good is because they teach you the ability of hand-eye coordination. It teachs you hand-eye coordination because if you are typing a report or a paper you can watch the screen and you can type at the same time and if you watched your typing you probale mess up or hit the wrong key at the wrong time or hit a button that delets all of your work, and that would be bad all of your hard work gone, and if that happened to me I would be really upset. Now my last but not least the third reason why computers are good because they allow you to talk to your family, friends, or bisneuss coleges. My uncle moved to @LOCATION3 about six, seven years ago and I don't get to see him a lot so my dad sets up the video camera for the computers and we talk for a couple of hours just to catch up on all the things he as missed out on. So in the end computers are a good thing to have because they teach you about faraway places and people, it teaches you hand-eye coordination, and it allows you to talk to family, friends or bisneuss coleges.",8
562,"To the local Newspaper Computers are so wired into our lives these days that without them we would be nothing. Computers are good things in our lives, they are positive machines that can help a persons communication, entertainment and one day maybe even a job. Computers are machines that if one day all disaphered, the human race would be caught on a state of confusion. Imagine life without a computer. It would not only communications from buisness to worker but also friends and family. Computers can enhance a persons learning. For a example, in schools computers are tools that are used to help with a child's learning or understanding. If I dont understand something the internet is where I go. It has everything right there for me. I can look up anything from persons of the to different animal spaces. That @MONTH1 seem lazy but the real thought is would I go out of my way t a to find one little or detail? I wouldn't have the time to do that and I don't think many other kids do either. Where would many of our classes go? Many kids are visual learners and a computer is a prime place to learn for them. For a example its much easier to see the effects of on a computer than a book. Its a lot easier to see the effects of on a than a book. Intell we find out has to put a video on a on a book, computers will be the best place to see things on action. What about on a computer. How could a student figure out where is place in a needed without a @NUM1-@CAPS1 model. A @NUM1-@CAPS1 something should look like when its finished. Then the communications. There are so many emails and it should be amazing to see then in one. How would a business notify that the. answer as a contract. Computers are would not way more than many people think. Thank you for listening to my opinions, I hope it will sway you thinking. ",8
563,"Dear, Newspaper, @CAPS1 I think using the computer is a good thing, we are able to learn new things about places that we just cant go to. Another reason is that we can talk to our friends online. But most importantly we can know whats going on in the world. We can learn new things like the @CAPS2 in @LOCATION1, or like the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 of @LOCATION2. There are so many things you can find out about places than having to get on a plane everyday to learn about the place. It is also good for reasearching for projects. this is one of the reasons why is we should use a computer. We can also talk to our friends online. lets say you have a friend that moves away and there is no way to talk to that person, with a computer you can talk to your friend still. It is also a good place to find out what homework you missed or just to talk and say hi. My last reason is that we know what is going on in the world. the computer is a @CAPS3 place to look up the news, weather, and sports. The computer keeps you up to date with the news. It also might tell you what big things people are doing like what the president does and some issues that are hapinng in the wrold today. This is why I think we should use computers.",7
564,"Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, Computers have benefited society in a very good way. They can teach hand-eye coordination so that in the future you can type without having to look at the keyboard. Also you can do your home work and not have worry about your ""dog eating it"" or ""you accidently dropped it in your fire place"". It would be saved into your computer for later. @CAPS2 you need help with a class you can go to an online tutor for extra help on a school website. Computers also give you the advantage to learn about faraway places and people. You will be able to find directions to other places. For example: @CAPS2 you to find @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1, travel @CAPS3 on @NUM1, turn on to the merrit parkaway and get off on exit @NUM2. Now people can learn about their great grandparents by going on websites that have your family tree. This is better than hearing stories that do not have all the information. Computers are now letting you chat online with your friends and family. You can use a webcam so you can see your friends and talk to them. Now people are playing online and you can meet your friends their and hang out. Lastly you can meet new friends around the world or even in your own town or city. All these reasons are why computers benefit today's society. We are advancing technology everyday so people can learn on computers. ",7
565,"Dear local newspaper, Some experts are concerned that people are spending to much time on their computer and less time exercising. Well people who are on the computer all day everyday is techinaly exercising by using there fingers and eyes. It's not bad for little kids because you could have a program for the kids tohem. But than you have the adluts who just on it just because. It bad for everyone because the power the money is just being wasted. Then although if people are on the computer could go to exercising programs but no it's like these couch patotos they just don't want to move. What company should do is have a limte for how long a person has been on and maybe people might do the right thing. US people think the computers are good cause we could talk to new but then people forget there family. Being on the computer could also get you in alot of trouble like for example talk to some one and then they send threats. People say that you could bring your computer everywhere well in fact thats true. Now see everyone has a laptop thats portable and these no relgure compture they could always use the laptop. Laptops are good but it still stops are problems people on it all the time if these not at home, when your out side people still on it. What a way to make these people not use the computers? Well what the companys are going to have to do is put a timer on it then there a rest button that will tax you when ever you rest it again.",8
566,"Dear newspaper, More than @PERCENT1 of the whole world supports technology and computers. People use it in their everyday lives. Using computers benefits the soceity. I teaches everyone new skills and gives hand-eye coordination. It also gives online resources like dictionaries, encyclopedias, maps, atlases, and many others. In addition, it gives people a way to communicate and share ideas. Computers are an everyday resource and without them nobody would be as educated and without them nobody would be as educated and advanced as the world is. First of all, they teach people that they can use throughout their life. When people use the mouse to move the screen with their eyes, creating hand-eye coordination. Also, it teaches people facts an skills like to read and write. To use a computer and know how to read and write, but if they don't the computer has many programs to teach people. It also allows typing which makes writing neater and for most people can be done faster. The computer is a useful fool to teaching people everyday skills. Secondly, the computer has many online resources. It has dictionaries to look meaning or spelling of a word, the to improve vocabulary and find synonyms for words, encyclopedia to learn additional information on topic, people, places, structures, or others, and many other resources. It helps people expand their knowledge and learn information about history, people they are to meet, places they are unable to go or things they would see computers widen people knowledge and allow them to experience for themselves. Lastly, computers allow people to communicate and share information or ideas. There are many different programs that allow people to chat privately pr publicly. They have places to share opinions or ideas and places to meet people. Nowadays there are many people meeting friends online. Also, if people discover new information or have new ideas they can share it with the world in a fast easy way. Overall, computers are a useful form of communication. In conclusion, computers are useful tools that can benifit peoples everyday life and the society. They teach people newskills and supply them with new knowledge and also serve as helpful resources to find new or reinforce information. Also they are a new, modern more advanced and quicker way to share information with people all around the world. So clearly the computers are very helpful to people all around the world and they can benefit the society.",9
567,"Dear local newspaper, I don't think that the computors benifit society. Computors take away time from; family and friends, forms obesity,and less time for excercising. As a result of, the computor, it has tooken time away from family and friends. If everybody is always on the computor everybody would be bored if they had time with their family. Also people would be bored all the time from not being on the computor. When you're on the computor you can't hang out with a friend. So, there will not be as @MONTH1 friends if everybody is on the computor @NUM1. Compared to family and friends obesity is a very very big issue in the @LOCATION1. In fact is, when you are side tracked you double the amount you normally would. A scientific fact is that when your stomach is full and you eat more than your stomach holds it will grow bigger. Obesity is caused by eating and you sometimes eat when you are doing nothing or are bored. I relize, you have read this letter so far, so I will say excercising is the @CAPS1 important thing to do in life. Even if, you are not obese you still want to excercise to keep yourself in shape. Excercising is good for you so don't delay on it. Excercising is: fun, exciting, keeps blood moving, energizing, and best of all, you can do it with friends! I have no idea about who's reading this, but I love nature! I could go outside for hours on end in the sun without stopeng. Nature is good for you and animals. Do you have a dog? Well, I know for a fact dogs love walking too. To rap this letter up I want to say, that computors definitly do not benifit society! For reasons like friends and family, obesity, and excercising.",8
568,"Dear local newspaper, Computers benefit society and have a positive effect on people in everyday life. As a student, it helps not just me, but others with school work, learning about faraway places, and even lets you talk to friends online. Let me elaborate more on these ideas. Although you @MONTH1 think doing homework on the computer is wrong, it can be very useful. In @CAPS1 class, we have vocab every week. Instead of looking in the dictionary and searching for the definition, we could just go on the internet. It saves time and effort. Also, when you are trying to write an essay for collage, or any other reason, it would look more professinal and neat typed rather than written on lined paper. Furthermore, you can learn about exotic places and famous people you have never been to or met before. Computers give you a chance to feel that adventure! You can see pictures of famous sites and even book an flight to go there with people on the internet, you can find the newest gossip about them. Also, you can even find out where and when a famous singer is going to have a concert. As you @MONTH1 know, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 are popular chatting sites. They give people a chance to communicate. My cousin lives in @LOCATION1, so I could never see her, but because of the computer, I can catch up on special events that happened in our family. A study showed that students have better relationship with their friends than to students who don't use the computer. To sum it up, I think now you could agree that computer benefit the society. They help students with school work, let you have better knowledge of places and people, and help have a stronger connection with relatives and friends. Please take all these ideas into concideration.",9
569,"Dear @CAPS1, I have recently heard in our school newspaper that some people think having computers is a bad idea. @PERCENT1 of computers owners say that this is not true. @NUM1 of @NUM2 graders say computers have helped them a lot. In my opinion having computers is a good idea. First, having computers is a good idea because it teaches hand-eye coordination. All the time you spend on your computer typing will benefit you. It will benefit you because while you are typing, you are also teaching yourself hand-eye coordination. This will help you later in life. And the you become better. And it is great to have excellent hand-eye coordination. Scientists did a test and the results showned that when you have better hand-eye coordination it helps with lots of things. In conclusion, having a computer is a good idea because it teaches hand-eye coordination. Secondly, having a computer is a good idea because it gives people the ability to learn about different places. For example, @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION1 lets you see @CAPS2, @LOCATION1, the moon, and the constilations. It also has a flight simulates. On computer you can learn new languages or a sentences to any language. I remember one time when I bad to surly and do a report on a country. I was @NUM3 grade and I @CAPS3 @CAPS4. This really tought me me a lot. In conclusion having a computer is a good idea because it gives people the ability to learn about different places. Lastly, having a computer is a good idea because it allows people to chat with friends. For example, @CAPS5, I have a @CAPS6 and I have about @PERCENT2 friends on it. I spend on the @CAPS5 talking to friends. It really helps with with typing tem. On it I get in of things, and even when I am absent from school I get the homework. @PERSON1, a therapy, says that kids relieve stress when they chat online with example. In conclusion, having a computer is a good because it allows people to chat with friends. To conclusion, having a computer is a good idea. A good idea because it teaches kids hand-eye coordination. Also it gives people the ability to learn about different places. And it people to chat with friends. Hopefully this provedes you to put this is the paper. The fate as people knowledge about computers is in your hands.",9
570,"People spend way to much time on the computers. There are many things that make people lazy and not excersize such as @CAPS1.V. to video games but I think the computer is the worst one. When people are spending their time on the computer it is turning off your brains and your bodys causing you to not wanna do things for the rest of the day. There are also ways to chat with friends online where you just sit there and type when really you could be out doing something active with that friend. Lots of kids like to play games on the computers these games can be addicting and cause kids to want to do nothing else but play there games on the computer just like how some people like to watch @CAPS1.V. the time. I do think computers are a good thing when used appropriately, teachers can use computers for grading, typing up notes for their students. Kids can also use computers for there school work such as a typed out project a @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5, and @CAPS6-mailing teachers. All the time People are spending on the computer using @LOCATION1M, @CAPS7, myspace, and twitter they could be spending time with their familys, doing their favorite activities such as @CAPS8, soccer, field hockey, baseball, ice hockey, exct. or hanging out with friends. Nowadays lots of people have cell phones anyways so if it is important that they talk to someone, instead of spending all that time on the website they use they can simply call or text someone while doing something fun and active outside. Computers should be used for school work and research only because those are things you need to get done but other that that kids should rarely use the computer and get more excersize. People should cut back on how often they use computers.",9
571,"Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 is a conflict going around about computers being a help in socity or hurting socity. I was told to wright a letter to my local newspaper aboutt my opinion on this argument. My opinion is that computers help socity. Computers helps socity because they teach us nit only hand-eye coordination but about abot what is happening in town or any where in the world if we didn't have computers life as we wouldn't where we are today. What mean by thout is we wouldn't know how to make life like @NUM1 diagrams to exat proportions for example when people dasign building or what not they first draw it out then they make the blue prints and final disign or the computer. Also bosness wouldn't be the way thyere because without computers @CAPS1 would be no websites with no websites computers would have to rely on newspaper and customers word. Secondly people would not know other people places. If people didnt have computers to know people @NUM2 other places @CAPS1 might be people might ask ""how is that possable"" so will explain. Computers let people interact with her and if we couldn't talk to people of her then we couldn't realy got a good or of what that place is like to go @CAPS1. Also you would have to go to the airport or call to book a ticket. With the help of computers we can book a flight online. Lastly, computers can help people get to know each other. for example, facebook, facebook lets people get to talk without a phone so you can see money on your phone bill, websites like facebook lets them communicate. Now that I stated some of the meny ways computers help, I would like to thank you for your time reading this paper.",8
572,"Dear local newspaper, I support advances in technology. I support because people can talk online, make easy payments, and teach people. All of this can be done with one peice of advanced technology that is used all over the world. One reason is that people can talk online. You can talk to anyone you know. For example, you can talk online with far away family members, faraway friends or just friends you never get to talk to. In example, people can talk online with people the don't get to see very often using the advanced technology we have @DATE1. Another advantage with advanced technology that people have is the advantage to make easy payments online. For example, people @DATE1 shop online, pay bills online, and even pay insurance. Many people @DATE1 use the internet for making payments, seeing it as an easier way for them. As a result, making payments online is easier than doing what we did without advanced technology. Another thing people use our advanced technology for is learning. People learn how to fix a problem with their computer, how to make or build a certain thing, and even help with acedemic studies. In example, they can learn more about math, science, social studies, gramar, ect. As a result, people learn from advanced technology without having trouble understanding what they are tryin to learn. In conclusion, there are many advantages for people with the advanced technology we use @DATE1.Those advantages are talking with people from faraway, making easy payments online, and having a better learning experience.As a result, I support advanced technology because it makes peoples lives easier for them.",8
573,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 in the late @DATE1 and has been around, ever since. It's the computer. I think that the computer has a positive effect on our society. It helps us gain more knowledge, have easier communication, and helps hand-eye coordination. In the following paragraphs I will expand on these reasons. Science, @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION1, @CAPS2, etc any topic you name the computer knows it. In fact it has been proven the computer itself can teach you more in one week than a three week college course! We wouldn't want to take away such a wonderful oppurtunity to expand on or knowledge,would we? My uncle an infectus disease doctor told me he has found a diganoses for many of his patients because of research he has done online. With forty percent of scientists and doctors admitting a lot of their knowledge came from the computer I think it is pretty clear how important the computer really is. It has already helped us find cures, diganoses, treatment, and much more..who knows what other areas it will one day help us in. Saying goodbye to someone you arent going to see for awhile that you love isn't any one's favorite thing to do. Luckily, with computers you don't have to! The computer offers hundreds of ways to communicate with others no matter how far away. Worldwide communication has imcreased ninety-four percent since the computer was @CAPS1! Now that's a lot! You can video chat, voice chat, email, instant massage, facebook, and, much more to communicate. The other day when my sister went back to college we missed each other so much we video chatted that very night! It was like he was practically in the room! With computers you don't have to wait on long to see or talk to the ones you miss. According to the . Today's the @CAPS3.S the top neuro suregeons in the world. Fifty percent said they thanked computers for their great hand eye coordination. Typing without looking is one of the best ways to improve your hand-eye coordination. My very own doctor told me one very important skill every surgeon must have is good hand-eye coordination. I think we have computers to thank for this. As you can see computers are very important and helpful to our society. Where would we be without them? We certainly wouldn't have as much knowledge, communication, or as good hand-eye coordination as we do today. This is why computers have a positive effect on people and our society.",9
574,"Dear local @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers are an iseue. Have you ever thought that computers are eating away at the little life you have? Yes computers are good for projects and websites But these days people are using them for unnesesary purposes, such as facebook or twitter, webcams, and computer texting. So meny ways of communicating and people end up rellying on computers. I love facebook (who do eat?) and I feel it's like an extencion of school with out the learning. You get to see and talk to all your friends and play internet games to conect chatrooms and such but one of the most simple resons there on facebook and twitter in the first place is because they dont and or can't hang out with there friends at home. So if our parents would give us more freedome on school days we woulden't be online. Another ishue worth adressing is webcames I under stand if we don't want friends over but webcames is a way of being lazzy and on computers. well without webcame we get more active like walking around or playing games and with webcames you sit there and talk while & camra watches your every move. One last thing I want to tell you guys about is computer texting. If you have an e-mail, like me you can get free texting and send a mesage to any phone you want so you are texting wile your brain is stick on the computer screen. I say just call them and work up your comunication tecniqes. Well now you know why computers are such a big isue. facebook and twitter are a manet to children, webcames just watch you, and computer texting is a new low on texting so to finally solve all this all parents should let the kids have friends over a lot mote than they do now. thanks for lisining,",8

576,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 more and more people use computers, but I think that it doesn't benefit out society.

Spending too much time on the computer @MONTH1 seem fun and all, but you won't @CAPS2 all the exercise you need. If you don't exercise you're most likely going to @CAPS2 love handles or a tire in your stomach. Going on the computer a lot will make you become addicted. Addiction is wehre you become dependent on it and when you want to stop, it's hard to quit. You also won't @CAPS2 enough sleep because of online chatting. Sure, it's easier to do than calling that person, but the more online chatting you do the longer you do it. You want to stay up because you want to keep talking to that person.

But really look around you outside. Nature is amazing. Going on a hike up mountain sure is hard but you'll @CAPS2 the exercise you need and the sight is amazing. Which brings me to my next point. There are more jaw-dropping things in nature than a gossip column story. Really! us kids need fresh air @CAPS1, so @CAPS2 out and play an hour a day! The last point of my opinion is you interact less with your friends and family members. Your friends will stop inviting you over because you'll seem distracted because of drama you got yourself into and they want to spend time with you not snap their fingers in front of your face. Your family an friends all want to spend time with you, but all you want to do is talk to people on the computer. You'll lose some friends becasue you interact less with them. Friends want to spend time with friends! Is this really how you want to live? Although the computer @MONTH1 be fun and easier way to access information it will always have cons. to become less addicted to it cut your hours shorter. Don't be addicted! @CAPS2 out and play!

For example @CAPS4, myspace and more all those websites help you talk end make friend overe the wed without calling them end texting them end even make friends that live in a diffirent country and even askinf them guestion that is there country diffirent or to your country and even if it's a good place to vesit. That why we neend computers. In cunclution, @CAPS5 are great for people to have. one reason why it will help kids from going outside end geting it to problems. Second reason is it will hlep people learn more about are country end diffirent country. The last reason is you could talk to people around the world.",9
579,"Are computers good or bad? More and more people each day are becoming addicted to the internet. Some people love it. Although, some people disagree, and are against it. Is the internet really making people go against nature? No. I, for one, think the computer is a great device. It lets you talk to friends, learn about the world, and even make new friends. Search engines like ""google"" or ""yahoo"" are a great way to find out information. Someone can look up to @CAPS1 @CAPS2, good restaurants, or even music videos. Anything you think of, the internet probably has information on it. It's almost like a personal library. One thing people love is friends. The internet is a great way to connect with friends. There's e-mail, instant messengers, and various other sites that allow you to talk to your friends. You can discuss whatever you want, without being in the same room. The possibilities are endless. Then there's other countries. The internet is a great way to find out about places you've never been to. This brings up the search engines and other people again. All you have to do is search for a certain place. Let's say you want to see what @LOCATION1 is like. Type in ""@LOCATION1,"" and you get tons of pictures and information on @LOCATION1. You can also meet people from other countries. You can talk to them, befriend them, and ask questions about their culture, language, customs, and more. The computer is a very helpful thing to have. It's not always a cure all for boredom and laziness. As for the lack of exercise, that's not the computers fault. That's the person's fault. It is possible to enjoy the internet and nature, friends, and family. You just have to want to.",8
580,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I think that computers are very useful. I think this because you can communicate with friends, find out what's going on in the world and find @CAPS1 ways to exercise. These are all things that you could do without a computer, but it's a faster way to find it. This makes more time in the day to do other activities. Friends are important to us, so we try to talk to them as much as possible. This gives us reason to talk to them. You also might be able to find friends on the internet that you might've known from high school or elementary school. This way you can see if they are married, have kids, or what they are doing for a living. As a result, you can keep in touch with them. You can find out sports scores, breaking news, laws being passed; or even @CAPS1 jobs, @CAPS1 schools, info about history. The internet has basiacally everything on there. The internet has activities for all ages: kids, teens, adults, and elderly. You can find out about good restraunts, good gyms, anything that might be advertised. As a result, the internet is also a good marketing place. Some people say that we aren't getting enough exercise. Yet, if they didn't have time to exercise they wouldn't be able to have time to work. Most people are walking around all day anyway. You cant find healthy food online, exercise equipment gyms, how to do an exercise the right way, you can find ways to cook food healthier. The internet is also used for ways to find how long an average person should be working out/exercising. As a result, people who say we don't exercise enough are wrong because they (the people using the internet) are usually using it to buy exercise products. The internet is also used to keep track of stocks, big companies, and many other features used in business. This is what some people do for a living so they sit a computer all day but they still get exercise; they are using/exercising their fingers. Therefore, they have nothing else to do until the get off their shift. Besides, most people are using their smart phones for the internet so they could be exercising and using the internet at the same time. This means that they could go on the internet anywhere and be doing something else instead of using their phone (unless they get updates).",9
581,"I believe that computers are used way too much. Many people across the world, are becoming obese and out of shape, People are relying on the internet to contact eact other. What happens when technology fails? Also prosle are forgetting how to speak and act in the real world. Computers do many good things. most of these things are advertised, but what you don't see advertised is all the harmful things they do to you. I don't know of a person who is not sitting on their rear-end while using a computer. People are most likely on the computer for around an hour or more. So sitting down this entire time could have potential to run your posture. And cause back problems. Also when someone is on the computer they are not exerzising like they could be and should be. The average person wands to live a healthy lifestyle and look good right. Well sitting at your computer for that hour you could have been excercising is not going to help you achieve that goal. Another point I'd like to being us is that many people rely on e-mail ad internet to contact each other. Well, what happens when technology fails @CAPS1 sometime it will, And lots of people will be lost. If a sports coach cancels practice @PERSON1 for some doesn't spend or a few parents can't or don't have the opportunity to check their e-mail, they and there children will be left there wondering where everyone is, @CAPS2 is something I've noticed around me. Since students and adults talk on the internet so much, they really forget how to talk and act in society. This could pose as a major problem for a business man or spokesperson giving a speech. Or a salesman might lose a sale @CAPS1 he treated the customer with disrespect due to the fact that he just did not how to talk to the man. On the younger side of this teens use the @NUM1internet to talk a lot, when they get into a real life situation they won't know how to go about it or handle it, this making it awkward. In conclusion, I think that in a way computers are ruining society, They are a major contribution obesity and lack of exercise, they are heavely relied for communication, and lastl, they can manipulate the way you speak and act in society.",8
582,"Computers have pro-and-con effects on our society. Many people believe that computers have a major positive effect on our country, yet some people believe that computers have a major negative effect on others. It is important to know that computers do improve hand-eye coordination and can be used for educational use. However, there needs to be some physical activities in each person's day. Each of these topics are the pros-and-cons of the debates experts discuss and argue on. Hand-eye coordination is a positive effect from computers. When a person types words up using both hands all fingers they are improving hand-eye coordination. Musicians need very good hand-eye coordination. They can't look at the notes and fingers at the same time, they need to look at the notes without checking what they are pressing. Musicians can improve their hand-eye coordination by using computers. Computers are not just for socializing or improving you typing skills. Students need to use computers for educational uses more often. As technology changes, students are expected to do well in school to open doors in the future. Doing well in school means to follow direction. Study for tests, and create good projects with good information. Students must find good information through books. However, what happens when you can't have access to books (can't drive to library, parents are too busy, library is closed, etc.)? Maybe use a computer. Retrieving information is free. You do not have to borrow a website. People are able to do their projects using a computer. This is another benefit from using computers. There are negative effects from using a computer. Over use @MONTH1 cause obesity and might keep people from doing physical activities during their day. It is important to do very little socializing and other unimportant things on a computer. The percentage of obese people has gone up. this @MONTH1 be because of the over use of technology. So it is very important to do more exercise and less unimportant things on a computer. Computer both benefit and don't benefit our society. Beneficial topics computers do are improving hand-eye coordination and educational uses. Non-beneficial topics are the over use of computers. however, computers seem to benefit our society more than they don't.",10
583,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I think that computers have been a great addition to out technology. The computer can teach @CAPS2 people, different things. This wonderful addition has a great effect on people, like how you can socialize with people. Also instead of waiting for the news to come on @CAPS1 you can almost intantly have any news you want. The computer can do @CAPS2 different things. One is that you can learn things without knowing it like hand eye coordination. Also if you have to research some one for a project you could use books. But if the person is relatively new they might not have something about them in a book. Thats where the internet comes in. Also you @MONTH1 want to plan a trip and you dont want to call the annoying automated machine. You wont have to do anything on the phone with the internet. This is how usefull the internet is. You @MONTH1 be saying most people spend too much time can the computer. And if you don't have enough self control you can get special chip that allows you on the internet for a certain amount of time. The internet is every powerful thing. You can chat with other people no matter how far away. If you both true a web cam then you could chat and even see the person even if they are on the other side of the world. There are also some sites like @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5 that you could socialy know whats going on with people. And if your feeling down you cold past something. Even though most people who have an can see this you will feel better about venting you feeling and less frustrated. Lets say you planned a trip to @LOCATION1. you want to know what the weather is. Instead of waiting for the @NUM1 clock news, you can go on the internet and instantly know. Something with the news if ou are impatient and heard of new news you can look up instead of baging a newspaper. The internet can have books magazines and news papers online, so that saves trees which helps the earth. The internet is an amazing thing that most people take for granted. In conclusion you man learn things knowing it and not knowing it. You are learning to type and about around the world. You my also he update with you social life and talk to people you havent seen in a while. You can also know the news when ever you want before or even often shows on @CAPS1. You can do this all with the click of a mouse!! How amazing.!",9
584,"Dear Local Newspaper, I think that computers have a huge effect on people especially teenagers. As the years go on new pc games are coming out for the computers. As kids get these games they get hooked on it then they never come out of there room. My brother had a friend who played one of these games he used to be a really fit kid but now these games changed hislife. There is this one game that come out around like @DATE1 and I saw that @NUM1 million kids play this game. Those @NUM1 million kids will have a very short life because they dont come out of there room and all they eat is junk food. This has a huge effect on them they forgot about the outside world. I worry about these kids because they are throwing there life away. But of course I cant do anything about it because I am only a thirteen year old for gosh sake!! I have some examples and I want to share them with you. I decided to go on the website and create a ten day trial. I did this because I wanted to interview someone who I start interviewing him and he says he has a @NUM3 level @NUM4's and is the highest you can go. Now he must have a great life knowing that he played this game his whole life. My second example that I like to tell you is that one of my older brothers best friend loved nature it was his favorite thing to see. Untill one day he played this game and he played it all day and all night. He didnt realize what he was doing to himself till he got on a scale and weighed himself. Finally my last example that I would like to share with you is that this game is like nicotine. This game has @NUM1 million kids playing it and it just keeps going up. Kids are forgetting how fun the out doors are. If their parents take away these kids computer they would think that there life is ending. Now that is pathectic!! In conclusion I think that this game should be banned. The only reason why I'm saying this is because I dont want these kids to end up like my brothers friend. They can live such good lives if they want to. They could start by stop playing the game and setting a grip of themselves.",8
585,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 of people are starting to use computers. Some support the advances in technology and believe computers have a possitive role in society. Others think computers aren't that great for us. I gave this a little thought and decided to go along with the experts that say computers are bad. People who use computers spend less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Let me explain more about why computers have a negative effect on people. As I said, boys and girls in the @LOCATION1 that spend a lot of time on the computers don't get enough exercise. They would rather stay on the laptop than to go outside for a while and run or shoot some. Instead of getting the daily exercise they spend their day after school playing games and goind on emails and other websites. We can all assume that this is one of the many causes why children in our country are overweight and obese. If kids spent more time outside playing with friends then they would be healthier and happier people. Another reason why I think computer arent good is that people miss the beautiful nature everyday. Staying home on the internet in a closed room with no air isn't healthy for us. If there wasn't any computer then humans would go outside, enjoy the fresh air outside and notice the amazing trees, grass, and animals that are in the environment. You should look at the nature everyday and remember how beautiful it really is. However, with computers these days people are prevented from going outside and seeing everything that surrounds us. This is another factor that plays a major role with why people aren't healthy. Instead of interacting with family and friends you interact with a computer. Some people play games and get addicted to them. Soon, they start to stop going ""to work or school. Then, your parents get angry for skipping school and not getting good grades. If they keep it up students will not pass a grade and will need to stay back another year. If adults get addicted is a computer they will eventually lose their jobs and end up losing their home for not being able to pay off taxes and mortgages. They will stop talking with family and not have a strong bond anymore. The relationshop with friends will not be as strong and you will be by yourself. Some people that can't interact with their community end up being alone because of the internet. You wouldn't want people to end up like this in you family. In conclusion, I hope I have taught you many of the reasons why I strongly believe computers are not good for people. They prevent us from exercising, getting fresh air, and interacting with family and friends. More and more people use computers now and our community is breaking apart. I hope I have convinced you to agree with me and please consider to think the some way I do. ",10
586,"Dear @CAPS1, In this @DATE1, computors are becoming more and more a part of our daily lives. It seems as though people, especially teenagers, have a fetish with this technology. Some try to claim that this as a good thing, however, people have to stop and realize that it is not. A mere twenty years ago, when children got home from school they would go outside and play until it got dark. Now children go home and stare at computor screen until their parents kick them off. This unhealthy and studies show that as the number of computors in the @LOCATION1 rises so does the number of obese children. This issue also effects adults, who spend time updating their facebook status rather than taking a walk. If people continue to use computors lengthy amounts of time, health problems will continue to grow. The excuses people concact to explain their obsessions with computors are extraordinarily fable. For instance, people say that computors help improve hand eye coordination. However, playing sports such as tennis would do the same thing, but while improving your physical at the same time. Also, many on the computors give them the chance to foreign cultures; but the truth is books or documentation recource for . Finally, people enjoy the way computors allow you to with people; but no smiley faces typed into a text box can replace the sounds of human emotion you when you talk with someone on th phone. There are a few examples of there is enjoy a alternations to computors. Humans going on the computor all time deprives us of the chance to talk with others in person. There was one woman who became so obessed with a facebook game that she neglected her family. It became so bad that she cared more about growing virtual plants than making her children dinner. Also, if your playing computor games rathen than playing with your friends, you aren't getting the socialization humans need. One day your life will flash before your eyes, is a computor screen all you really want to see?",8
587,Well I think that using computers help some people in different ways and also it can be a fun positive hobby. But I dont think that being on a computer all day is good for you and it also can be very addicting to some people. But to me computers are fun and I think if you be on computers to much you should take a brake. And equal it out like doing other stuff or have other hobbys or even just try new things. Goin outside can be one enjoying nature can be another those are stuff you can do computers and nature sounds nice to me but I dont think banning nature or computers is good try both is my opinion.,5
588,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Some experts and some everyday people are starting to belive that computers have a negative effect on people. I do not belive this. Computers are very important. They help people learn to read write or even how to make @NUM1 equal @NUM2! There are even online colleges. Computers also help many students write an essay. I have written many essays on the computer. I even find my reaserch for an essay on the computer. A computer is an excellent source of comunication. Wether if your on facebook talking to a friend or sending an important document through e-mail. Big and smart buisness even use the internet for advertizing or to hire @ORGANIZATION1 employes. The goverment even uses @CAPS1 to post the presidents speech's if you missed them. You can also wath the super bowl doritos commercial's. Computers have many diffrent application type things. You can type a paper on microsoft word or try, to beat your dad's highscore in pinball. Computers were used to make the movie @CAPS2 one of the best movies of the year! Even I can go home and make one the most watched video on @CAPS1 on the computer. And my dad's tryingto beat my highscore in pinball. You guys at @ORGANIZATION1 use computers everyday! To write the story then post it to your website. That's why computers are good things not bad! So how would a computer have a negative effect on you if a computer tought you how to read or if you beat your dads high score in pin ball, and that at essay you wrote yea you probably typed it on a computer.",8
589,"Ever since they were invented, computers have been growing in popularity throughout the world. First, the amount of overweight and obise people has grown dramticly in the @DATE1. This could be because they are spending to much time on their computers and not enough time exercising. Also, because of computers, everyone is not enjoying nature as much. Lastly, the computer distracts people from seeing their family and friends. Therefore, computers are not a benefit to society. People spend too much time on computers and not enough time exercising. Exercising is necisary to maintain and good health. In @LOCATION1, more peole are getting sick because they have a low imune sysytem. getting off your computers and exercising would make the world a healthier place. Next, teens don't always get the exercise they need because of computers. The aversge teen spends @PERCENT1 of his/her day on a computer. If they could cut back and exercise more, they would get the exercise that they need. Another nreason computers do not benefit society is because they limit people from enjoying nature. Sitting in a dark room with the computer as your only light is not a good way to live. Going outside and enjoying sunlight. You can enjoy nature and get and next people spend long periods of time on the computer looking at pictures of places like rainforests. Why not plan a vacation and go there? Being outside in and around nature is very enjoyable. Lastly, even if it os hard for you to stop using the computer, go outside a little bit every day. Eventually you will be able to fully enjoy nature wihtout the distraction of computers. The @DATE1 reason computers are not a benefit to society is because they cause people to spend less time with their family and friends. Some say that the computer is a good thing and allows you to socially interact with friends and family over the internet. Actually seeing them in person is much better than typing to them on a computer. Plan to have lunch together so you can spend more time with your family. Right away you will realize that this is much better than chatting to them on a computer. Over all computers have a negative effect on people. They limit the amount of exercise that people get they don't enjoy nature as much and they spend less time with family and friends. This is why computers hurt society and not help it. ",10
